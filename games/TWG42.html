				<br />You are all out to eat at Milliway’s, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. <br /><br />Yes, you are watching the heat death of the universe from a well-shielded window on the planet Magrathea, several quintillion years in the future. Groovy decorations are everywhere and the atmosphere is fantastic. An empty hamster cage sits near your table, with an exercise wheel. The exercise wheel has a hoopiness level of 11.5.<br /><br />You are all researchers for the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a distinctive guidebook on how to travel across the galaxy on the cheap. Your queries at the U.S. Treasury as to the conversion between galactic currencies and U.S. dollars were not returned for some reason.<br /><br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/jwsO8W6.png?1)<br /><br /><br /><br />That’s about when <strong>Arthur Dent</strong> keeled over, mostly dead, from some poisonous cheese on his Arcturan Mega-Taco. Marvin, your Android, is out on some business and so could not save him. Who could have committed this crime?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the GM (GuideMaster?) Iron lost his plot sheet in a cross-country move, so you don’t have many clues.<br /><br />“From what I can piece together in my investigations,” says Ford, “it all has something to do with a rather boring country called Syria. Apparently they’re all fighting over something. A game of cricket, maybe?”<br /><br />“No, someone was testing chemical weapons on lab animals. Guinea pigs? Probably both human and nonhuman guinea pigs, in fact,” said Trillian.<br /><br />“Oh yes. And America is shut down for maintenance, right, and can’t be the world police at the moment. Sweeping up all the crumbs that were attracting vermin or something.”<br /><br />“No, I don’t think that’s right,” said Zaphod’s first head, adjusting the fish in his ear. “I’m pretty sure it had something to do with this Miley Cyrus cat, the second worst poet in the Galaxy, yeah?” Zaphod’s second head agrees, after a brief consultation.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size">something something Eddie, the Shipboard Computer</span><br /><br />You all put your head(s) together and decide on a course of action. Zaphod is keen on killing everyone in the room one by one until the murders stop. Trillian is completely opposed: “Arthur was a peaceful guy!” Suddenly, Zaphod’s Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses go completely dark, meaning something dangerous is about to happen.<br /><br />“Well that settles it, doesn’t it?” say Zaphod’s head. “What could be more dangerous than daily lynchings?”<br /><br />So it is agreed. <br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Rules</strong><br />“No lynch” is not an option. <br />Do not post at night, do not post or talk while you’re dead, don’t talk to other players outside the thread unless you’re allowed.

I <em>also</em> agree that you&#039;ve been a bit quick to jump on the bandwagon, but given that it&#039;s the first day, I don&#039;t find either of these moves condemning. Maybe That_Kids slightly more so, though.<br /><br />I like these Magrathean names people are giving themselves. I can&#039;t recall anything from HHGTTG that would suggest this, but I&#039;m honestly a little wary of just giving out a name. I have no idea if the names are actually meaningful (and they probably aren&#039;t), but the overly suspicious voice in the back of my head is always a little afraid that knowing someone&#039;s name will let an item be used against that person or something. But I&#039;m probably just paranoid. (Another part of my brain has noted that SwoopDoggyDog already sounds like a great Magrathean name).

				It seems a bit weird that you would come out with such information at all without any provocation. <br /><br />If you are NKed does the item disappear, or if the person you give it to is NKed does it disappear, or what? <br /><br />Either way, you&#039;re kind of just making yourself a person of interest for no reason.

				I think everyone was just distracted by the arguments/bandwagoning to really start anything, plus the slight confusion about when we would need to have all the votes in/end of the day. My vote stayed stagnant only because no one else came out as suspicious the first day, in hind sight probably not the best move on my part, But its a new day!

				I don&#039;t think we were targeting a wolf, but only because we weren&#039;t really targeting anyone. Like you said almost no one even switched their votes at all so there wasn&#039;t any real pressure.&nbsp; It might be safe to assume that at least one of them was around to watch out for a snipe that would hurt them.&nbsp; Phil was an obvious choice due to his characteristic lurking. Before there were any votes on Phil I honestly almost switched to him for that alone but it didn&#039;t really seem worth it.

				Hmm. One thing about items is that I don&#039;t think all of them are immediately useful, and so starting out with one wouldn&#039;t necessarily overpower the wolves (that is, cause the wolves to be overpowered). Dr. Agon could be a wolf, though I believe him when he says that he wasn&#039;t trying to snipe. If it <strong>was</strong> a true, premeditated snipe, then it&#039;s likely that a wolf <strong>was</strong> targeted last night, and was probably not Phil (so either swoop, dieter, or deathbutt). <br /><br />The odd tie and Dr. Agon being a wolf don&#039;t go together perfectly unless he is lying about not meaning to snipe. On the other hand, there&#039;s plenty of possibility, if no actual evidence. In general, wolves might have just been paying minimal attention (it was day one after all), and so on. I certainly believe that Dr. Agon wasn&#039;t aware of the night ending at the time, though. That&#039;s an honest mistake, wolf or no wolf.<br /><br />This makes me much more curious about items, though. I would like to know more about who gave items and/or who received them, but I don&#039;t want anyone to give away anything that might get them targeted. Figuring out if wolves can start with items could be key in determining whether Dr. Agon is a wolf.

				I do have an item.<br /><br />In general, however, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily a great idea to announce all the people who have items, and what items they have. I definitely think there are some cases where things such as trades could be used to help confirm humans or to exchange items and create combos or something (I don&#039;t think me using this item would be useful, but details suggest there may be ways to make it beneficial). However, this also means that revealing which items you own might make the wolves know who might get powerful all of the sudden. There might be some good ways to make it work, but everybody revealing willy-nilly what they have isn&#039;t worth the risk.

				I would think items would have something to do with the game (Maybe combining them?) But then again I did make a game where everyone was fake guard and it was awful. I trust Iron with making a good game though, especially 42.<br /><br />I&#039;m personally still iffy about Dr.<br />I believe the snipe was an oopsident but trying to get people to come out with items was kinda off to me.<br />I just see the &quot;I have a role(item) but I won&#039;t give info&quot; play as a wolfy thing.<br /><br />I was thinking about asking what item you had just as a means of getting some info so I could get more of an opinion but talking about this I&#039;ve realized it&#039;d be way too ballsy of a move for a wolf to call fake role on day one with no target on them. So I&#039;m gonna go ahead and say you&#039;re a human.<br /><br />So in my book we got three items floating around and three humans; guy, Dr., and Modi. (I would add myself to the list but since I have no useful info to help prove me straight up [except that I think I have a higher hoopiness level than most?] I&#039;ll let you guys be the judge of me).<br /><br />Anyways that&#039;s my 2 cents of what&#039;s up right now since Dr. was asking people&#039;s thoughts earlier this day.

				Why do you trust that Guy is human? You give no justification for that. <br />He&#039;s got an item? I don&#039;t buy it. Everyone who knows about them has a lot of reservations about how useful they actually are, which makes it increasingly likely that a wolf could start with one. <br /><br />As for (another), I honestly think it&#039;s pretty useless to try and communicate with that. For all we know it&#039;s just the ghost of Ford Prefect&#039;s father. Nothing it might &quot;tell&quot; us is trustworthy. <br /><br />Also, Trient, what&#039;s your deal with guy? It was pretty obvious that all he was saying was &quot;I didn&#039;t give the item to eep.&quot; Do you know something we don&#039;t?<br /><br />You two are at the top of my list right now but sadly that seems like it may be based more on simple activity than real suspicion.

If we take into account that Epp was not a wolf and two people have items(also assuming starting with an item means you&#039;re not a wolf which i don&#039;t know if i agree with just yet but thats easy to find out) It would leave the vote to two people with me excluding myself as not being a wolf. Neither of these people have done anything strange or condemning in my eyes...I think everyone jumping at AngryNarwhal/That_Kid might be silly. I&#039;m going with <b>Trientalis</b> who seems to have a little more info about items that we dont know yet.

				Deathbutt, where do you base the thought that wolves would &quot;need to know more about items than we humans do&quot;?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that would be the case as wolves can usually without understanding anything but that they can kill people, while &quot;we humans&quot; as you say need to discover who the wolves are to kill them.&nbsp; That means that knowledge helps the humans usually not the other way around.<br /><br />This is just my opinion on the matter and I do think that confusion is not inherently human, but also not a &quot;wolfy&quot; thing to do.

				I&#039;m not finding enough evidence to really convict anyone, even on re-read. There&#039;s lots of interesting information, but none of it incriminating. Here&#039;s my thoughts on all of the people:<br /><br />1. Guy - helpful and active sort. Would be very dangerous if using misleading tactics, but seems to be reasonable if nothing else.<br />2. Modi - that&#039;s me.<br />3. Epplant - Died N1<br />4. Deathbutt - seems keen on first impressions and instincts for the amount of info we have, but that&#039;s understandable given that the info isn&#039;t really geared towards proving anyone&#039;s a wolf.<br />5. Dr. Agon - not sure. Some people seem to really trust him, despite the fact that he&#039;s suspicious. This makes me suspicious of those people (guy).<br />6. Trientalis - was a tad confused on items, which is understandable, but inches her closer to being a wolf<br />7. Phil - Lynched D1<br />8. SwoopDoggyDog - unknown. Is in the list of &quot;others&quot; (people w/o items not voted for last night)<br />9. AngryNarwhal - hasn&#039;t fought with guy all that much, haha. Is in the list of &quot;others&quot;<br />10. That_Kid - is in the list of &quot;others&quot;<br />11. Dieter - hasn&#039;t posted today. &gt;:(<br /><br />The people I am most suspicious of are Narwhal, Dr. Agon, Swoop, That_Kid. I&#039;m not as in line with others as to Dr. Agon&#039;s innocence; I just don&#039;t see much support for that. It&#039;s true that he&#039;s been helpful, though, so I&#039;m going to go with <strong>Narwhal</strong> for now.

				I feel like everyone thought there was something off about Dr. Agon&#039;s play, but that he wasn&#039;t actually a wolf.<br /><br />Narwhal did push back a little, I suppose, and I honestly don&#039;t have much against him. Something like Dr. Agon + Guy would make some sense as a wolf pair, but Guy&#039;s reasons are not bad. It seemed like he was much more sure than those reasons would actually suggest though, but that could just be a matter of interpreting intonation in a text-based forum.

				I actually kind of feel like narwhal is acting pretty human, and at least not particularly wolfy.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t have a lot of &quot;special&quot; knowledge, just knowledge that becomes useless when I say something about it now (ie future proof).&nbsp; I have a feeling dieter is a wolf and have since day one, but I also think I have a strong chance to get a read on him if he ever posts.&nbsp; not a certain read, but more than a 50-50.&nbsp; more like a 65-35 read.

				Okay, lotsa stuff happened before the end of the day last night, and not everybody input input since then.<br /><br />Anyway, I wasn&#039;t particularly happy with either of the potential lynches on the stack at the time (Dieter and Narwhal). I hate lynching purely because of inactivity, and I didn&#039;t have a whole lot of evidence against Narwhal. I was okay with Dieter being killed though, even if I wasn&#039;t gonna contribute to the votes; inactives aren&#039;t helpful to either team.<br /><br />I&#039;m still suspicious of Narhwal. Guardian claim is well and good, and makes it very risky to kill him, which is annoying, because I rather distrust him at this point. I do not believe that items are useless. I believe that, in previous states of the game, one could not really use items. I am nearly certain that items DO have some sort of use, and I even have hints as to what those uses may be. Things such as having more than one item, and perhaps hoopiness are going to come into play, though I don&#039;t really know how. I would have LIKED for the item to have been saved, but despite what guy said I don&#039;t think there was much I actually could have done about it? Switching to that_kid would have just broken the tie, leaving Dieter dead no contest. I didn&#039;t have much to contest the lynch anyway, since it&#039;s the unfortunate truth that inactives rather hurt the game. <br /><br />Furthermore, I am not 100% certain that the item is gone forever. This is a risk on my part, but I can pass my item even after being dead. No idea if this applies to anyone else&#039;s items, but Dieter might have passed whatever he had despite being killed. Seems kinda unlikely though, in all honesty...

				I am also still very suspicious of narwhal.&nbsp; probably more now than before, because guardian is stupid to prove.&nbsp; It should be obvious though if he is human because a seer (if s/he is not dead and exists) would probably have viewed narwhal last night.&nbsp; if he came up human, the seer is probably remaining silent for now, if he came up wolfy, I expect that we will here some pressure on him.&nbsp; I for one, would like to know who narwhal has guarded the last 2 nights?<br /><br />Modi, is there more you want to share?&nbsp; I know you put yourself at risk (according to you, that seemed to put yourself at less risk since you are now saying that killing you doesn&#039;t prevent your actions from being made (maybe).&nbsp; that seems a bit off to me at first impression.&nbsp; I may need to read it again and get another feel for it.

				I want to be a cool kid and make a list of things I think are going on.<br /><br />• guy: started with an item, which makes me assume he&#039;s human. I thought he had posted who he had sent the item to but I can&#039;t seem to find it/maybe I&#039;m making that up. I&#039;m leaning more towards human.<br /><br />• Modi: Has item and hints on item usage. May be able to help out those with items and figure out how to use them/what&#039;s going on?<br /><br />• Deathbutt: Too kind of a person to kill someone like swoop. Has 1 million hoopiness, or maybe poopiness? Avatar makes me smile. Knows how to post skater grunge music so that I can hold a jam party.<br /><br />• Dr. Argon: First one to talk about items. Seems human to me.<br /><br />• Trientalis: started with an item with same description as guy&#039;s (super intelligent shade of blue). Been very under the radar and it makes me nervous.<br /><br />• AngryNarwhal: claimed guardian when pressure was put on him. Doesn&#039;t believe in items (or Dieter?). Gives me a bit of a shady feeling.<br /><br />Trientalis and Narwhal are who I would like to hear from the most this day.

I originally felt that items could have been useless, since mine was not usable on its own. <br /><br />I&#039;m also not saying they&#039;re super important, but I think they are related to roles somehow.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to be really careful with what I say for now, until I can identify a suitable person to give things to and maybe trigger a cool power; in the meantime, the wolves would probably want to *block* that power if they could find out what sort of combo is needed. I don&#039;t want anybody to talk too much about the stuff they do have either, which makes it rather difficult for me to figure out who to give stuff to, but I think will be safer in the long run since wolves&#039;ll hoard items or just trade them among themselves in order to reach a good combo.<br /><br />The threat obviously isn&#039;t getting killed for having a role-item, it&#039;s getting the wolves to convince you to give them your items and thus steal our powers and give the wolves powers.

				Alright, so I have been gone for the past couple of days. My item is no longer with me. I passed it on. I am not sure what happened to it now that it is passed on. All that I know about it from when I had it is that it could synthesize with either of two things. One would have been helpful in some way, and the other would have done nothing. So, because I don&#039;t know what either of the things actually did when they synthesized, or even if it would synthesize anything while it was in my possession, I passed it on.

My item is no longer with me. I passed it on. I am not sure what happened to it now that it is passed on. All that I know about it from when I had it is that it could synthesize with either of two things. One would have been helpful in some way, and the other would have done nothing. So, because I don&#039;t know what either of the things actually did when they synthesized, or even if it would synthesize anything while it was in my possession, I passed it on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It was also suggested to me that synthesis was a thing that could occur, though not necessarily with my original item, which has something to do with hoopiness. That&#039;s what I&#039;ve been talking about most of this day, and Trient has helped to confirm it a bit. Well, I wasn&#039;t really told that items would synthesize, just that having multiple items could lead to gaining a role. I got Doctor Agon&#039;s item last night (I assume, since I think it&#039;s the only one left that we know was passed on).<br /><br />I would like to vote <strong>Narwhal</strong>, though I&#039;m hesitant to kill a guardian claim especially if any more evidence comes out. Doctor Agon did apparently have an item and gave it to me, which maybe slightly increases his chance of being human, since I would expect wolves to mostly trade items between themselves, especially since I think the item he gave me has a good chance of being useful. Then again, the knowledge of synthesis wasn&#039;t around then, so who knows. I still think that it&#039;s evidence against him being a wolf, if only slightly. I have no idea about guy, though. I kind of trust that Death Butt has actually been busy and stuff, and has been around occasionally, and at least reading every once in a while. If he is a wolf, I still trust that he&#039;s been busy, since a very bad way for a wolf to help out their side would be to do the exact same thing as Dieter.

				I can confirm that I tried to pass my item to Modi.&nbsp; I am doubting that both the people that apparently have knowledge about items are human.&nbsp; My guess is that at least one is a wolf.&nbsp; That is based on that is how I would make it.&nbsp; then again, I assumed the same thing in the dueling packs game and I was wrong then.<br /><br />I also believe that DB has actually been busy, but my fear/feeling is that he will continue to play the way he is now (which leaves us unable to get a true read) rather than rejoin the game.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see him play, especially since he usually has some good insight.<br /><br />Modi, I gave you the item because I felt that we needed to get items used sooner rather than later (because the game may be getting close to ending one way or the other.&nbsp; I thought about giving it to narwhal, but I was afraid that he was a wolf at the time.

				I re-read through this day&#039;s posts. I&#039;ll vote for <strong>Modi</strong>. He has been talking so much about items and stuff but we haven&#039;t really gained anything from it and I feel like he might be playing up the cautious human bit or something. It&#039;s possible he&#039;s human and excited about the mechanics, like when I got all caught up on talking to the first (another), but he&#039;s also voting for Narwhal despite not really seeming to have a reason hat justifies killing a guard claim that I can see.

				I am most suspicious about people who are acting like it is suspicious to know about an item <em>that you started with</em>.

				I get back from Canada, and not much (nothing?) new has happened...<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly certain that guy is human (else I wouldn&#039;t have given him the hooloovoo), which means that Dr. Agon was also a human, as shown by priest. There are cases where guy could be a wolf, in which case Dr. was probably also a wolf. I&#039;m not sure what this would imply in terms of items, though, since priest isn&#039;t exactly useful to a wolf, and I&#039;m not sure what kinds of things would be made up: it&#039;d be very easy just to say nothing happened and get me killed for talking about item fusion.<br /><br />That_kid, Narwhal, and Deathbutt could be on either side, as far as I can tell.

				I&#039;m not sure about That_kid. There&#039;s been a lot of pressure on him all game, and he&#039;s certainly not un-suspicious, but mostly there&#039;s just been awkward turns of phrase and a categorization in a group of people day one that turned out to be largely human anyway. I think the most suspicious thing was his treatment of guy today, which might have been an honest mistake or could have been an attempt at killing guy and then switching when under too much pressure?<br /><br />I find it interesting that both deathbutt and narwhal were voting for me yesterday, but not very much, since I think that was a reasonable thing to do given what was known. Recent days give me slightly more hope for narwhal, I think, but I do not know.

				So... Deathbutt and I were the only two that didn&#039;t vote for That_Kid, so if that kid was a wolf, that suggests one of us must be the remaining wolf, which would mean a vote for death butt would be highly appropriate.<br /><br />However, there is some reason to believe there were not two wolves yesterday, since there was a minimal amount of pushing. <br /><br />Death Butt has been very quiet lately, and is probably actually busy and not just hiding, since hiding probably isn&#039;t that helpful at this point. The fact that he hasn&#039;t responded at all or really said anything containing content within the past two days is maybe a little suspicious though. <br /><br />Killing guy would have made sense from pretty much any wolfy perspective, since guy holds the item confirmation stuff and the role... So that doesn&#039;t help much.<br /><br />Concrete evidence against Narwhal is low... So I guess the wolf must be <strong>Death Butt</strong>?

				Also, just looking at the people who were NK&#039;d and lynched to remind myself who is essentially guaranteed human.<br /><br /><table class="bbc_table"><tr><td><span class="bbc_u">Lynches</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td><span class="bbc_u">NKs</span></td></tr><tr><td> phil </td><td> eepjeep </td></tr><tr><td> Dieter </td><td> SwoopyD </td></tr><tr><td> Dr Agon </td><td> Trient </td></tr><tr><td> that_kid </td><td> guy </td></tr></table><br />So, of phil, Dieter, Dr Agon and that_kid, one pretty much has to be a wolf (assuming two wolves). Dieter was an inactivity lynch and phil was a D1 lynch, unlikely to be a wolf. That leaves Dr Agon, who was killed in a three way tie with that_kid voting for him, and that_kid, who was killed by another, narwhal, and guy, who we can assume was human.<br /><br />End of day Voting Record:<br /><table class="bbc_table"><tr><td> Day </td><td> Modi: </td><td> Narwhal: </td><td> Death Butt: </td><td> Another: </td></tr><tr><td> 1 </td><td> --- </td><td> guy </td><td> Dieter </td><td> --- </td></tr><tr><td> 2 </td><td> Narwhal </td><td> Dieter </td><td> Dieter </td><td> that_kid </td></tr><tr><td> 3 </td><td> Narwhal </td><td> Modi </td><td> Modi </td><td> that_kid </td></tr><tr><td> 4 </td><td> --- </td><td> that kid </td><td> Modi </td><td> that_kid </td></tr><tr><td> 5 </td><td> Deathbutt </td><td> --- </td><td> Modi </td><td> Deathbutt </td></tr></table><br />So. It looks to me like Another had a pretty good idea that that_kid was a wolf, Narwhal voted for him, and Modi refrained from voting. That looks to me like good evidence that Modi is a wolf and that Narwhal is human.

				As I said, there are two cases:<br /><br />1.) That_Kid was a wolf. In this case, Death Butt was the only person besides me that didn&#039;t vote for him. This was the only push against That_Kid being lynched at all - true, I didn&#039;t vote for him, but if me not voting for him is wolfy, than you voting for someone else certainly is. <br /><br />2.) That_Kid was not a wolf. In this case, neither Death Butt or me voting for someone else is necessarily suspicious.

				Blah. There&#039;s not a lot I can really do to convince you, it&#039;s not like I have any solid evidence and your mind seems made. But I feel like I have to try something because the whole human team is depending on me to convince you that Modi is a wolf. You and (another), really, because without both your votes it&#039;s at best a tie, which I guess would mean a random choice?<br /><br />Anyway, the way I see it, guy was the least likely to be lynched of the living players, so he makes sense as an NK for anybody.<br /><br />And I do think that Modi&#039;s declining to vote at all is pretty telling. Adding a human vote, even if it&#039;s made by the roll of a die, makes the odds better for the humans, especially in the end-game when there aren&#039;t many humans.

				So is your mind made up? I can&#039;t just give up here...<br /><br />(Another), if you want to try any form of communication or indicate that you are willing to consider changing your vote, could you please change your vote to Narwhal temporarily and let Iron know to update the vote count? I promise this isn&#039;t an attempt to snipe something or whatnot. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1103.msg49684.html#msg49684">Quote from: Orangeangrygangbanger on November 09, 2013, 02:11:51 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As a wolf, he would be losing a much greater percentage of his team&#039;s votes by not voting.

The only people with votes on them were that_kid (2) and Modi (1) when he made his first post of the day, and then you voted that_kid right after his post, putting that_kid up to (3). Explicitly voting for a third party late in the day with no hope of getting traction would require him to commit to opinions and ideas and in particular it might look like an attempt to save that_kid, or at least a defense of him, which he would not want if that_kid were to generally be considered a wolf. Instead, he let it happen and just expressed a lot of vague ideas:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1103.msg49602.html#msg49602">Quote from: Modi Thorson on November 05, 2013, 07:02:06 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m not sure about That_kid. There&#039;s been a lot of pressure on him all game, and he&#039;s certainly not un-suspicious, but mostly there&#039;s just been awkward turns of phrase and a categorization in a group of people day one that turned out to be largely human anyway. I think the most suspicious thing was his treatment of guy today, which might have been an honest mistake or could have been an attempt at killing guy and then switching when under too much pressure?<br /><br />I find it interesting that both deathbutt and narwhal were voting for me yesterday, but not very much, since I think that was a reasonable thing to do given what was known. Recent days give me slightly more hope for narwhal, I think, but I do not know.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now if he were a human I think he&#039;d have been more willing to take sides.<br /><br />Also perhaps telling is that that_kid did not vote for modi to try to save himself. Modi already had one vote on him from me, so if that_kid and/or modi were innocent, it would have made sense for that_kid to try and save his own skin, rather than not voting for anyone at all. that_kid didn&#039;t vote for a third party because that would raise questions about why he didn&#039;t make an honest attempt to save himself by voting Modi, thus implicating Modi.<br /><br />So that&#039;s how I see it. Obviously there is more than one valid interpretation and it&#039;s hard for me to judge my own objectively, but I think it&#039;s a pretty decent argument.

				Yeah and then he killed him before guy could do anything about it beyond confirming Dr Agon. Admittedly that is what got that_kid lynched, but afaik it&#039;s not clear that Modi knew exactly what power he might give guy.<br /><br />One argument against that_kid+modi team is that that_kid created a tie between Dr Agon and Modi instead of saving modi by voting for narwhal at the end of D3.<br /><br />However, that can also be seen as that_kid attempting to create a three-way tie (Modi, narwhal and dr agon) in a subtle attempt to shift the odds in Modi&#039;s favor for the tie break, instead of being the guy who sniped narwhal. (Another)&#039;s switch from narwhal to that_kid kinda fucked up that plan but they got lucky anyway.<br /><br />So, I&#039;d say that&#039;s at least a plausibility argument for a that_kid+modi team.

				It seems to me the more we examine it, the more I see that Modi would have to be an incredibly ballsy wolf relying on some crazy gambits. <br /><br />Which I guess isn&#039;t outside of the realm of possibility, maybe he&#039;s just totally bluffing the shit out of me,<br /><br />but you&#039;re still a safer vote to me.

				Well, I failed in my evil, wolfy plans to kill all the humans... =[<br /><br />I brought out some good stuff at the end there but it was an effort made too late. <br /><br />Well played, humans, but you got lucky too. Trientalis was killed in some sort of NK backfire, which really screwed us up. I think Trient could have stayed under the radar even longer than I did.<br /><br />And the (another) vote seems to have been a curse that moved to me after that_kid died. Interested in getting the full story on that. <br /><br />But in the end it was close and Narwhal&#039;s gut instincts saved the day for you guys, so congratulations, Narwhale.

				<br /><br /><strong>Guide Entries:</strong><br />Mankind (https://soundcloud.com/joey-collard/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-6)<br /><br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s skip ahead to Day 6, which is a good bit and has got Marvin in it.<br /><br />By the way, I&#039;ve finally got my plot notes in hand, and just in time too! No worries!<br /><br />Zaphod is trying to explain something to Trillian. Trillian, an ape-descendant, is perfectly capable of understanding thanks to her degree in astrophysics. Zaphod, however, is a politician and therefore has no idea what he is trying to explain.<br /><br />&quot;So picture a cosmic bathtub, right? Like, a nice porcelain one with gold feet and the latest in laser drain technology, yeah?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Are you trying to explain the origin of the universe to me again, Zaphod?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, no, babe, this is something different. Check it out: In the bathtub, you could be at, like, the drain, maybe. Or you could be at the spigot, yeah? It&#039;s all the same, dig?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not really, but go on.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So it&#039;s like a difference in space but not in time! But it could be the other way around, right? It could be a difference in time but not in space, right? Well the Restaurant we&#039;re in is like that! It&#039;s built on Magrathea (remember when we went to Magrathea?). Died off completely about a million zillion years ago. Some sort of...weasel, I think...got in the life support system and gummed it all up.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What does that have to do with the wolves, Zaphod?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m getting to that! We&#039;ve been getting closer all along, you know. And we better hurry, too, &#039;cause I don&#039;t think we have much time. We&#039;re all about to be dead guys if we don&#039;t act fast!&quot;<br /><br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/2uFArne.png)<br /><br />Just then, the door between the Restaurant and the parking lot bursts open. In walks a plastic robot with a crude wooden leg and lined with rusty bolts.<br /><br />&quot;Marvin! You&#039;re back! We&#039;re saved!&quot; shouts Trillian, running to him. <br />&quot;Hey, if it isn&#039;t my favorite cool cat, Marvin!&quot; says Zaphod.<br /><br />&quot;If I had a sense of humor...which I haven&#039;t...&quot; droned Marvin, &quot;I would say you are all about to wish I was a cat. Is that amusing? I hear cats are very droll.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why would that be amusing, Marvin?&quot; asks Trillian.<br /><br />&quot;Oh. You haven&#039;t heard. Then I&#039;m afraid I have some bad news,&quot; replies Marvin in an emotionless voice. <br /><br />Outside the protective dome, the heat death of the universe is winding down with a spectacular display. The great chrono-winches reel the Restaurant back across time to prepare for the next sitting.<br /><br />Just then, the walls begin to crumble like cheese filled with too many holes. The controlled atmosphere begins leaking out, and poisonous vapors begin leaking in. Enormous four-legged, low-bodied robots tunnel their way in, putting the Krikkit warbots to shame.<br /><br />The white mice in their cage escape just as a ninth appears from thin air, and all run toward the robots. Hatches pop open at the approach of two of the mice, who climb inside and take control to smash at the remaining rodents. Laser cannons pop out to point at AngryNarwhal.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">WITH THESE MAGRATHEAN TECHNOLOGIES WE WILL RULE THE UNIVERSES</span> proclaim the mice from their loudspeakers. <br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">YOU. ANDROID. YOU WILL READ TO US THE ANSWER TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTION OF LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, AND EVERYTHING. IT IS PRINTED ON THE EARTH FEMALE&#039;S BRAINWAVES. READ IT BEFORE WE DESTROY HER.</span><br /><br />&quot;I can read it,&quot; says Marvin. &quot;But you&#039;re not going to like it.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier;" class="bbc_font">READ IT!</span><br /><br />&quot;It says...&quot;<br />&quot;Database Error.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wolves have achieved parity with humans.

				Wow. That_kid claims wolf and then says I&#039;m his partner and you guys vote for me?? Nice move by that_kid I guess. Did much better than I did as a wolf in eep&#039;s game. <br /><br />Dunno why Modi&#039;s passing the item convinced just about everyone that he was human. Probably the sort of thing I would have done I guess. He wasn&#039;t giving me much ammo against him either. <br /><br />So, nicely played Modi and that_kid. <br /><br />And iron the game was very fun, though at times I felt a little useless without powers or items but it wasn&#039;t too bad. And the hitchhiker&#039;s stuff was done really well. I had a hard time telling what was taken from the books vs what you made up, especially in the entries. Overall, well-balanced, just the right amount of wtf is going on and well-moderated.<br /><br />And narwhal I hope I didn&#039;t sound too sarcastic in the end, there. <br /><br />gg

				this was a hard game for me because i just started doing this again and i didnt know what the hell was going on at first but it ended up being really well put together. Iron, you did a hell of a job meshing what you created to what is actually a part of the guide. I was a little sad that i didnt really get to play the seer as well as i wanted but it was still a solid game!<br />
