				TWG XII: Murder Mansion<br /><br />Creak&#8230;.<br /><br />Creak, creak.<br /><br />Creak&#8230; pop!<br /><br />Everyone jumps and the cross country tour bus slows to a stop. Outside the rain pours. the tour guide speaks in hushed whispers with the bus driver. Then the tour guide gets everyone&#8217;s attention. &#8220;It seems the bus has broken down, since its almost night time, and the rain is pouring, we won&#8217;t be able to repair it right now. Conveniently, we appear to have stopped near an abandoned mansion. We&#8217;ll sleep there for the night and then repair the bus and continue the tour in the morning.&#8221; the tour hurriedly enters the mansion, after a meal they all find an empty room and go to sleep. <br /><br />Everyone wakes to the sound of a scream. Haplo, the tour guide, was found stabbed to death in the entrance. the tour bus tires and wiring have all been slashed. the rain has gotten even more ferocious. Obviously this murder was committed by a person or persons on the tour. in a fit of panicked stupidity, the group decides the only way to get rid of the murderer(s) is to vote and kill off 1 member a day, until they kill the murderer(s).<br /><br /><br /><strong>Basic Rules:</strong><br />There are 2 teams, murderers and tourists. &nbsp;the object for either team is to eliminate the opposing team. Rounds are divided into nights and days. &nbsp;During the day, all players deliberate on who they think are murderers and cast votes to lynch someone. &nbsp;During the night, murderers decide on a target and are allowed to kill someone off. the tourists win when all the murderers are dead, and the murderers win when murderers &gt;= tourists.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Other Rules Include:</strong><br />-No talking at night (This means no posting in this thread until I say the day has started)<br />-No private messaging to another player, meaning all discussion must happen publicly via posting. (Murderers are allowed to communicate to each other privately)<br />-you must post at least once per &#039;day&#039;, or you will automatically get a vote for yourself<br />-<strong>you may only vote three times per &#039;day&#039;.</strong><br />-the day will automatically end if one player receives a majority of votes<br />-Murderers and special roles must send their nighttime kills/guards/sights within a reasonable period of time, preferably less than 24 hours<br />-you may not copy/post any private messages from myself or other players into the game<br />-No posting if you are dead (this should be obvious)<br />-All rules will be subject to my discretion<br /><br />If you do not know if you are allowed to do something, ask first!<br />Violaters of any of these rules will be punished!<br /><br />New people feel free to ask me anything you need help with.<br />Green text is flavor and may possibly hold game related info.<br /><br />All roles have a name associated with them. the names are meaningless.<br /><br />Player List:<br />1. Phil<br />2. Guy<br />3. <del>Enig.matic</del> &nbsp; Murdered Night 1<br />4. <del>Liquid Angel</del> Murdered Night 3<br />5. <del>Dietrich</del> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lynched Day 3<br />6. <del>Ben</del> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lynched Day 2<br />7. mystic<br />8. <del>Dr. Agon</del> &nbsp; &nbsp; Lynched Day 1<br />9. <del>Daron </del> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shot by Dietrich Day 3<br />10. Iron<br /><br />PMs will go out shortly. Day 1 will start soon and will end Monday, Nov 2nd at midnight.<br /><br /><br />

				1. Phil - hasn&#039;t been on since the 28th, I&#039;d probably say he&#039;s safe for the time being. No point in killing inactives, at least.<br />2.

Liquid Angel - probably a meteorologist, doesn&#039;t do anything else <br />5. Dietrich - I&#039;ve already done the only thing I&#039;m capable of.<br />6. Ben - suspicious to me, won&#039;t give out his name but apparently can do something<br />7. mystic - forgot his name, but he&#039;s too valuable to lynch on D1<br />8. Dr. Agon - neutral<br />9.

				the roles are mysteries. getting an idea about the game is more important to humans than getting murderers on day one. the murderers don&#039;t have to care as much about the game mechanics because they can kill regardless of any other factors. we don&#039;t get that benefit. we have voting and roles. if we limit ourselves to only half our arsenal, we don&#039;t win.<br /><br />making small talk hints to everyone about the game mechanics, which you have to abuse to win.

				I&#039;m not really a meteorologist. I just happen to have a coat, so I figured I&#039;d say it was going to rain, however; after looking at the first post again I realized the flavor text said that. I&#039;m suspicious of Guy for having powers but no item. If there is a thief I&#039;d guess it&#039;s him seeing as how he can see passes (or something like that). I also want Ben to talk more. <br /><br />For now I&#039;d vote <strong>Phil</strong> because he has been inactive and our best chance for doing anything useful is keeping people actually playing in the game, and a best case scenario is we hit a murderer that would&#039;ve slipped by.

It has also been clarified to me that Daron didn&#039;t realize it was from me, but rather, that he simply found it. So I guess that part checks out. My point is that we seem to have two mechanics/people capable of fixing things, and I&#039;m guessing one of them is almost certainly a murderer. Either Enigmatic or Daron.<br /><br />My thinking is wait a day or so and see what happens with them. the real mechanic will likely get murdered - can&#039;t help that anymore. Then kill the other one (unless he&#039;s somehow a tourist too, but I can&#039;t see the purpose of two tourists that fill the same role). Alternatively, if the original owners of the items don&#039;t get their items back, we know whose asses to kick.

				Well at this point I&#039;d say it&#039;s a safe assumption that we are dealing with two murderers, yeah? Seems like an appropriate number, what with our various items and powers.<br /><br />Obviously I think Enigmatic or Daron might be one.<br />Other suspects: Dr. Agon - well, not especially. I think Greg might be important, but don&#039;t forget that he exists and could easily be a baddie.<br />Iron - I realize this is his first time, but he basically hasn&#039;t contributed<br />Maybe Ben, I wish he would post more..

If you don&#039;t know who to believe, don&#039;t give it to me either, I don&#039;t care.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Either way, you (a) got the timing wrong on mine, (b) nobody knows anything about Ben and whether or not you&#039;re in cahoots, and (c) you made up my action today at 10:00 am.<br /><br />It was that horribly unbalanced game of AJ&#039;s I think, and Haplo was actually the seer even though absolutely nobody believe him. you claimed the baker equivalent so that I wouldn&#039;t kill you, putting the nail in Haplo&#039;s coffin (and also humans got our asses totally kicked).<br /><br />My point is you&#039;re making up a story, one that opposes me. Same as last time, and I&#039;ve been a human both times.<br /><br />How would you benefit from my dying? I mean, it&#039;s one more human lynched - who cares how it&#039;s done? Maybe I&#039;m useless, but I&#039;m basically a confirmed human (given, a werewolf could be given a gun to start with, but that&#039;s up to you guys to believe me).

				Also, I don&#039;t <em>have</em> to get the gun back. It just enables me to verify Daron&#039;s identity. He can give it to anyone else - that&#039;s up to him - but I know I will be suspicious of him if I don&#039;t get it back. That can&#039;t be helped.

				you are hardly a confirmed human.<br /><br />My story didn&#039;t oppose you until you said I was lying. I saw you do something, so asked you what it was.<br /><br />Based on flavor, it makes sense for a murderer to start with a gun. Based on the game, you&#039;re right, it doesn&#039;t. I&#039;m really confused because I can&#039;t see why you would be lying about doing something if you weren&#039;t a murderer.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how the time is definite evidence. I was saying around because it could be anytime.<br /><br />With your example, I was claiming something to kill a seer. Here, you&#039;re suggesting I&#039;m claiming something day 1 to kill a regular human.

				the confirmed part is up to you: do you think there is a murderer vigilante? I don&#039;t. I also know that according to fluff, Haplo was stabbed to death. Given, fluff isn&#039;t worth much, but it means a gun definitely isn&#039;t the only weapon a murderer could use.<br /><br />the reason I&#039;m lying about doing something is: I&#039;m not lying about anything! I gave my old gun away, that&#039;s it.<br />the simple story is, you&#039;re the one lying here.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,471.msg18528.html#msg18528">Quote from: guy on November 02, 2009, 08:31:36 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If I were throw myself out in the open as a wolf, I&#039;d want to take down either a person who is a special role or someone who could possibly be a special role over someone claiming they&#039;re nothing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />the plan wasn&#039;t to take down someone special - it&#039;s to survive. you make yourself seem important enough, make up a few stories, make Danny seem like the crazy one - they&#039;ll believe it.<br />Werewolves aren&#039;t supposed to sacrifice themselves; they&#039;re just supposed to cause dissension within the ranks.

Yeah, I posted before I even gave the gun away. But either way, no way you found out at &quot;around&quot; 12:30 pm.

				What about Daron? Yeah, he gave Kyle his coat back, but maybe that was just to clear his name. I know I still don&#039;t have my gun back - he could be hoarding it. He also might still have mystic&#039;s item held hostage, I don&#039;t know.

				What I needed fixed was that I was entirely mortal and itemless and therefore unable to effectively defend myself, either in the forums or against player actions. I started making a deal out of it just because I needed something to say, or I&#039;d be lynched like all pure humans eventually are.<br /><br />When it got fixed was when I uncovered a power/role. I&#039;m not sure what to parallel it to in previous games, but basically I&#039;m a hypnotist now. Kind of like a nonviolent vigilante, maybe? Except I can gather the people &#039;killed&#039; to our side. But I don&#039;t know alignments, so what Guy saw me be tired from that one day was probably an attempt at that.

				iron&#039;s name is mark...? oddly related to his ability, and this isn&#039;t the first time i expected relevant names<br />phil claimed a role early that seems to match<br /><br />danny repeatedly didn&#039;t want to vote phil, tried to get votes off phil and listed iron as a possibility multiple times (though never put a vote on)<br /><br />suspicious that iron DEVELOPED a power<br /><br />matt saw everyone do stuff with some accuracy. we&#039;ll never know what ben did or did not do and <em>i didn&#039;t do anything</em>. i meant to test this later when i did something but i fucked it up which could cost us a lot of valuable information.<br /><br />i&#039;ve yet to really go through the confirmed human (night kills) posts. but anyway wolves killed enig.matic to allow daron to repair to gun while preventing other items to be easily fixed. dietrich was obviously a wolf for many reasons. arguments between him and others should be read.<br /><br />guy is really probably human. dietrich continually voted for him and tried to start bandwagons against him. the chance of this being a set up seems really low.<br /><br />early on i suspected dietrich. so i asked him (page 20) who he wants dead to set up for this later. he answered guy. so...<br /><br />as it is i would probably vote for me... but that&#039;s nonsensical since i know what i am. it&#039;s probably not matt. so that leaves iron and phil, and the more suspicious of those is iron. both he and phil have been leaving hints of their abilities, but only phil&#039;s checks out the whole way, while iron got to develop a power later. this seems fishy, although admittedly a good play. and possibly true, but doubted.<br /><br />maybe he named the right power he actually has and already used it on someone? but then the game would be over, i think. unless haplo is counting that phil can save someone.<br /><br />iron voted phil. ugh this is aggravating. BUT danny wondered why i questioned it.<br /><br />thought:<br /><br />iron use your ability. your choices are me or phil. if you choose phil and make him human, we probably win. if you choose me to try and make me human, we&#039;ll confirm me as human. or, if you choose one of us to make us wolf<br /><br />well<br /><br />gg?

				Hmmmm...<br />I honestly Kind of believe him too, as he does note several times throughout the days that he doesn&#039;t have a power <em>yet</em> And, Matt as far as I&#039;m concerned you&#039;re confirmed since you somehow pulled through that night where there was no kill.<br /><br />So really, I think if anyone&#039;s the last wolf it&#039;s going to be mystic.<br /><br />I mean, he really hasn&#039;t done anything to confirm he&#039;s human, and while his item <em>is</em> defensive, it isn&#039;t necesarily defensive in the best way, if I understand what the item does it triggers as someone leaves their room and kills them, and while it could be used against a murderer the likelihood is much higher that he wuold hit one of the assisting roles like myself or Liquid angel. also, am I the only one who finds it odd that danny (our only confirmed murderer) was the only person&nbsp; other than michael who started with an item and no role?

				Hmmm...<br />Is it usual for the guardian equivalent to be among the last to reveal power? &#039;cause that&#039;s Phil.<br />I guess I&#039;m OK with putting Guy in the clear...if he&#039;s a wolf, we still have a shot if we leave him alive for tonight. <br />And mystic obviously has nothing with which to defend his position. <br /><br />My personal favorite tree is...putting mystic and Phil as equals, lynching one of &#039;em, and then assuming that Matt&#039;s good (or even if he&#039;s not, conversion has a shot), we win!

				Also if the wolf doesn&#039;t get lynched, I&#039;m dead in the night. Phil is second most likely target, having fully revealed that he hypothetically can&#039;t defend his own self.<br /><br />I&#039;m also wondering about initiative...I assume wolves kill as the last action of the night? So maybe I could convert before dying?

				generally there are no rules governing it, it just happens all at once at the gm&#039;s discretion. conflicts don&#039;t come up<br /><br />that being said there is absolutely no reason to assume matt&#039;s a wolf unless your power worked last night, you&#039;re a wolf, you converted him last night and the fact that phil&#039;s power is protection is what is continuing the day (normally the game ends with equal humans/wolves)<br /><br />yes it&#039;s usual for guardian to be last. you can assume why<br /><br />each person&#039;s favorite tree is one of the not-matt not-self ones

				also phil dropped hints most of the time, and they checked out<br /><br />of course he could have been trying to lure out the real guardian if there was one, which seems a rather phil-ish thing to do (phil&#039;s techniques tend to vary anywhere from brilliant to &quot;i saw his card&quot; though...)<br /><br />that being said, iron dropped hints too, HOWEVER, the problem with iron&#039;s hints is that any player with any non-item power could have dropped the exact same hints for them to check out. this play beats out history-checking in late game, which is odd because no offense but it seems like iron wouldn&#039;t know how to make this play, unless he&#039;s done a significant amount of reading other threads or researching the game<br /><br />so, maybe he has<br /><br />it&#039;s quite a pickle, still.

				my logic says iron due to the danger of his ability. but i think that&#039;s just a fear. i don&#039;t think a lot of use will come from it because a failure today is probably a loss even if that ability is used<br /><br />my gut says phil just by trying to interpret danny, but phil is playing it off too cool-y<br /><br />it shouldn&#039;t be matt. and i&#039;ve avoided saying this until this point but i know it&#039;s not me and even if it were i wouldn&#039;t be voting for myself. from the two choices i have to go with <strong>phil</strong>, knowing full well that this could end the game either poorly or correctly basically up to chance. but i&#039;ve read the thread too many times and my gut says this is the way to go. there was no guaranteed way to win, as my trees pointed out, mostly due to iron&#039;s power only working at night<br /><br />so here we are.

				I felt that I should point out what I thought was the correct play for the last day.<br /><br />Phil should have lied and said he could protect himself.<br />Then you guys should have voted for mystic. At best mystic had pretty shaky evidence that he was human. I really felt you guys should have suspected him more.<br />Then you would be left with a guardian and a bullet proof. Phil then guards guy and hopes Iron targets guy.<br />If no one died that night, its obvious that Phil wasn&#039;t lying about guardian. So they both vote Iron.
