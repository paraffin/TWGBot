			<dd class="postbody">
				Your spaceship has crash landed on an unknown desert planet. You and the rest of the colony were sent to start inhabiting a new planet, unfortunately, this is not the planet you were intended to land on. Everyone panicked after waking up from stasis. Many never even woke up. More died as you tried your best to survive the harsh conditions. However, one woman stepped up to the plant. Her name was <strong>Epp</strong>. Thanks to Epp, you folk have managed to figure out a way to live on this planet, making use of ship parts and the natural environment. You&#039;ve worked out a temporary solution that should last for several, and are merely waiting for a passing spaceship to see your beacon.<br /><br />Things were looking great, however all was not well. The planet&#039;s atmosphere must have affected some of your crew mates. You wake up to find that Haplo had been viciously murdered in the night. You all cry out to Epp and ask her what you should do about the murder. Perhaps, not quite right in her own head, Epp determines that you must all decide to vote on who the murderer is and then she will execute that person at sundown. She then secretly assigns 3 players to be her guards, in order to watch her back at night. And thus begins your little colony&#039;s 2nd fight for survival.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">There are a few unique rules, so please read them</span></strong><br /><br />Rules<br />1. Epp is the Leader. She has 3 abilites.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Epp is a confirmed Human.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Epp cannot be night killed while a guard still lives.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. If there is a tie for a lynch when day ends, Epp will choose between one of them to kill(she can choose to kill someone she didn&#039;t vote for if she wishes). <br />2. After the day has ended there is no night talking. Only Epp may post in the thread, and only if there is a tied vote, in which she will choose which to lynch, there can be no trying to sway her decision after night has been called.<br />3. There are 3 guards to start with. When a guard dies, they will be revealed as a guard. <br />4. If the psychos(wolves) attempt to assassinate Epp at night while a guard lives, 1 living wolf at random will be revealed upon daybreak.<br />5. Each day, eveyone will vote on 1 player to lynch. At the end of the day, Epp will execute whoever has the most votes.<br />6. Wolves win by killing Epp, throwing the colony into chaos.<br />7. Humans win by killing all the wolves. <br />8. Unlimited votes<br />9. 48 Hour days and 24 Hour nights.<br />10. Days/nights will start/end at 10pm EST. <br />11. You may not post the contents of your PM(you can still make claims, but your not allowed to post the wording in order to attempt to gain an advantage. <br /><br />Player List.<br /><del>1. AngryNarwhal</del> Lynch D1<br />2. Epp<br />3. Guy<br />4. Reaper<br />5. <del>Modi Thursday</del> Killed N2<br /><del>6. AJ</del> Lynch D2<br />7. Iron<br /><del>8. Dietcar</del> Killed N1<br />9. <del>Phil</del> Lynch D3<br />10. <del>Deathbutt</del> Killed N4 <strong>G</strong><br />11. <del>Big Bird</del> Killed N3 <strong>G</strong><br />12. <del>Trientalis</del> Lynch D4<br /><br />All PMs have been sent. If you somehow did not receive one. Please let me know. <br />

				Slightly more interesting is the fact that Bigbird claimed that BOTH he and Narwhal were humans, as though he had actually confirmed Narwhal already. On the other hand, he then went on to vote for Narwhal so he could just be acting randomly or chaotically.

				i don&#039;t want to focus too much on the claims, simply because i feel like they&#039;re more likely to create a distraction that&#039;s easy to hide under. modi makes a good point, though.<br /><br />if you&#039;ve ever seen the show misfits, there&#039;s this character nathan who does outrageous inappropriate shit all the time, and generally it&#039;s just irritating and serves no purpose, but there are several times when he manages to hide something by just doing something outrageous and inappropriate that makes everyone roll their eyes and leave him alone.

				If I remember correctly, the first post-PM post I made was the one where I voted epp. Bigbird and I have not communicated about the game since we read PMs. Which reminds me, <strong>unvote</strong> cause dat&#039;s silly. My first game WAS Dieter&#039;s asylum, so I trust no one, including the host, but we might as well play by the rules we&#039;re given :P

				@iron: 4+ turns away.<br /><br />Currently, we&#039;re selecting one out of 11 players. if we were to massclaim right now, then our choices would be reduced to 8. If no guard is killed today or tonight, then that will be reduced to 6. and then to 3, etc etc.<br /><br />though i suppose if it gets to the point where we are choosing out of 3, wolves are p much fucked.<br /><br />@guy: i thought ben was the one who always claimed spy

				ben was notoriously inactive. aside from that, i don&#039;t remember any characteristics<br /><br />phil is the one that always claimed spy pretty much every game. he also had a way of making players angry and i think tended to convince people by sheer brute force of continual arguments more than new logic. which was annoying, so it worked

				I haven&#039;t really had time yet to get fully caught up yet, but some thoughts I&#039;m having are:<br /><br />Mass claim seems like it could backfire just as easily as it could help out. But it seems kind of inevitable in a game set up like this. <br /><br />The game could be over quickly if a real guard were accidentally lynched, plus the wolves have decent odds to guess a guard on one of the first couple night kills. I&#039;m just thinking lets put careful thought into that strategy<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think it is next to impossible to sift through guard claims.&nbsp; As well as any sort of claim to prevent one&#039;s own death.&nbsp; This is a game of survival and anything anyone does is purely to fight for their side to win.&nbsp; A guard claim can mean ANYTHING.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why any claim like that could be valid or hold any weight.&nbsp; I only see drawbacks to doing that. As for the mass claim... if that were to happen... I foresee a shit-show... probably like 8 guards.

				The fact that vanillas are not very valuable is the exact reason that they should never claim guard to avoid the lynch. If you&#039;re a vanilla, take one for the team, do not risk setting the lynch onto a real guard and forcing THEIR claim.

				it was the same train of thought as people complaining that leaving any guard claim alive is bad because wolves are going to claim it too. i&#039;m saying that&#039;s not a bad thing because even if we learn the identity of a collective however many guard claims, the odds are in our favor because the wolves have to kill more players than we do. i don&#039;t think leaving a guard claim alive and having hem end up being wolf somewhere down the line is as big a deal as people think it is, provided we lynch them eventually<br /><br /><br />also i think phil was mostly tring to help gather information<br /><br />you could use the same logic to condemn trientalis because she thought the same thing or even me for thinking the opposite

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a very good idea to reveal a lot about who is/isn&#039;t a guard. This game is pretty tricky. If we focus on one person and accidentally reveal that they are a guard, the psychos move quite a bit closer to their goal. If we spread our accusations out, eep might reveal enough about who ISN&#039;T a wolf to give the wolves a pretty good idea of what&#039;s going on. Both of these are pretty extreme - we obviously don&#039;t all decide to accuse the same person simultaneously, but we also don&#039;t all accuse completely different people. <br /><br />But whatever the case, I think it&#039;s better to focus on people that have been accused rather than random people. Not that Epp actually said much by suggesting that Trientalis MIGHT be a guard, but it&#039;s pretty sensitive information overall. <br /><br />Phil asking about guards didn&#039;t strike me as particularly unusual.

I agree that claiming guard to avoid the lynch is not the best idea, unless you can be sure that it will move onto a wolf - it might otherwise move the lynch onto a REAL guard. However, claiming guard to draw the NK away from the real guards would be a conceivable idea if someone could do it without sounding really dumb, since a real guard would probably not claim under normal conditions.

				I don&#039;t think I want to guarantee the lynch for the next few days. Plus, like I said, Trientalis might be bluffing. In order, I am certain that Phil is not a guard, find it unlikely that guy is a guard, and cannot tell whether trient is a guard. Her question of whether a wolf might be one of my guards, does not strike me as a question a wolf would ask, and you were eager to add her to the list of people we should target.<br /><br />There is one player whom I decidedly suspect to be a guard, and my impression is that you know who I&#039;m talking about, guy.

It certainly narrows down their options, which increases their chances of killing a guard. Revealing all the not-guards is the same as revealing all the guards, though I suppose you are right that it could be done more slowly (though the problem with that would be the remaining guards, who we still would have a chance of accidentally targeting, in which case, with the wolves&#039; increased chances of killing a guard each night, could potentially reduce our survival time by a lot). It&#039;s moot though since Epp can&#039;t tell us with that much certainty. If she does have reason to believe that an individual is not a guard, I still don&#039;t think it would be that useful to tell us - it helps the wolves as well as us, and isn&#039;t all that surefire for us, either.

				it doesn&#039;t make any sense for the guards to know who each other are (from a game balance standpoint. from a flavor standpoint, of course they would). it&#039;s too powerful for 3 humans to know each other&#039;s identities at the start of a game.<br /><br />why do people want to lynch guy? he seems to have been reasonable so far.

If we get unlucky, we could be dead pretty darn fast. Of course, we can get unlucky no matter what happens, but I don&#039;t think that the guards would try to be tricky and make themselves appears as though they didn&#039;t know anything about guarding, since it marks them as okay lynches. Guards are probably trying to stay under the radar while still being helpful. AJ could very well be a guard. Based on these stats and Epp&#039;s ideas, it looks like the best lynch candidates are guy, phil, and trient.<br /><br />On the other hand, attempts at defending any or all of these three could very well be an attempt by one guard to protect the others (if there were a guard among these candidates). If guards know who each other are, their behavior may in some cases look almost wolfish in that they will try to protect one another from lynches and try to stay under the radar. This depends on the guards knowing who they are, of course.

I&#039;m just saying that since we can&#039;t seem to improve the 8/11 (27.272727...% chance of being a guard, ie more than 1/4) odds we should go based on how much value we expect them to add to the human side, roughly measured by activity.. The odds aren&#039;t awesome but c&#039;est la vie.<br /><br />Unless we can improve those odds. The argument for your not being a guard seems reasonable enough but tbh i haven&#039;t really evaluated it yet. Problem is we&#039;re pretty unlikely to find a mutually convincing reason. For example it would be quite simple and reasonable for a guard to feign ignorance about guards to reduce the chance of being NK&#039;d.<br /><br />I definitely think the first guard to be on the chopping block should claim so we can get info on them.<br /><br />@Narwhal; the rules say votes for eep are discounted and if we all vote for her she gets to choose.

				-losing guards is bad. lynching guards is awful.<br />losing a guard is not the same thing as losing a seer or a guardian in any other twg. it&#039;s worse and we should try to prevent it as best we can while looking for wolves. <br /><br />-losing vanillas is less bad than usual. we have a confirmed human that can&#039;t die (eep) that also decides ties. wolves would need to outnumber all of us to control anything, which probably isn&#039;t a reasonable thing to be afraid of<br /><br />-lynching vanillas is not necessarily a bad thing, or even counterproductive. the amount of good that we&#039;re missing out on by not lynching a wolf is not nearly as much as the amount of bad we&#039;re preventing by not lynching a guard. we have time on our side, i think. there are probably more people the wolves need to kill (3+1 known) than we need to kill (?how many wolves). lynching a guard is really bad and everyone learns immediately that they were guard. this is probably more helpful knowledge to the wolves than the humans; they can relax a little. lynching a wolf is great, but we have time. lynching a vanilla is not that bad<br /><br />-these are all additional reasons why guards in danger of being lynched should claim. and that we should think very carefully about whether or not to believe them and not just immediately learn towards disbelief just because wolves can do it too<br /><br />-using activity as a basis for lynching is as productive as random lynching. possibly less since an inactive guard could prove beneficial, as eep pointed out (wolves won&#039;t think to or won&#039;t want to nk)<br /><br />another thing i just thought of that is fundamentally different is that we&#039;re ALWAYS aware of how close the wolves are to winning. we always know how many of their targets are alive. i think this is another reason missing an opportunity to lynch a wolf is less bad, and a reason it&#039;s okay to leave guard claims alive, even if more likely wolf than guard (still/always a chance they&#039;re truthful). and, as everyone has pointed out- wolves are likely to guard claim too. so we&#039;ll probably have a good idea of how many wolves we&#039;ve gotten (if a claim isn&#039;t revealed as guard, they&#039;re probably wolf). we can always keep track of the progress of the game and use that to our advantage. we&#039;ll always know how dire it is at the moment to kill them.<br /><br />additionally and somewhat contradictory, this is a reason for wolves to not claim guardian, so that they&#039;re numbers are less well known, and because of that further reason to listen to guard claims, as there is NO downside to guards in danger of being lynched to claim. <br />(guards will always claim, wolves MIGHT claim)<br /><br /><br />my thoughts still seem too convoluted. i&#039;m positive it&#039;s logically sound so someone help me out maybe

Then there are probably somewhere between 2 or 3 wolves, which I am guessing three because of the size of the game.

There is certainly the possibility that a claimant is actually a guard, in which case we really don&#039;t want to kill them. On the other hand, wolves are certainly going to jump on this opportunity, which makes it rather tricky for us: we really don&#039;t have any way of knowing about such a claim, and any plans that we lay down now can probably be thwarted. So I think we&#039;ll just have to deal with this once some claims actually arise, and spend some time figure out what to do with an individual claimant.

				It&#039;s still 100% to lynch wolves. Without any other evidence whatsoever, I&#039;m putting a guard claim at 50/50 split between guard and wolf. Can we all agree that vanilla guard claim is a bad idea? If so, then a guard who claims is going to get NKed pretty quickly. Maybe not that night, but it will happen. Even if it is a vanilla, if I was a wolf I would not take that chance. PARTICULARLY on D1 where who the fuck else are you going to kill.

Again this is an example and should not be taken religiously.

				I agree with modi - that would not be the right reason to lynch phil. In fact, the entire reason I was a fan of lynching him at first, was the fact that he implied he wasn&#039;t a guard without outright stating that he was a vanilla. This is much better/less confirmed than a human just volunteering and saying, &quot;Oh, you can lynch me because I don&#039;t have any special powers.&quot;

				I wouldn&#039;t have much argument with being lynched at this point. That said, you could pick a better person to lynch given the amount of info we have had D1. And as epp correctly assumed I am as vanilla as they come, so all things considered if I were in everyone else&#039;s shoes I&#039;d be looking elsewhere. I feel most curious about Iron at this point, his play style seems off from what I recall. I also am inclined to be wary of deatbutt, because that number game always seems wolfy to me. Lastly, narwhal and his &quot;lynch all the claimants&quot; philosophy is riddled with wolf stink, and I find it pretty damn hard to believe he wouldn&#039;t be a wolf at this point. Of the three I probably feel the strongest about <strong> Narwhal</strong> as iron I think, while definitely different from usual, may not necesarily be different in a negative light.<br /><br />

I also find it odd that he voted for you so quickly, but there is still a lot of time in the game - it was neither a snipe nor a bandwagon. I can understand a vote for you - while you are the most likely of the three (according to Epp, who could be wrong) to be a guard, you are still one of the three least likely guards, and guy has been helpful. I am not sure why Iron did not vote for Phil, however - possibly just to place pressure upon you.<br /><br />

				Well claiming guard is a compelling reason not to lynch today, I think that much we should all be able to agree on, Narwhal.<br /><br />Never lynching guard claimants is also obviously a bad idea and nobody is suggesting this. It might be a reasonable idea to lynch guard claimants the next day, assuming they survive, but that is not a good general rule either since the wolves would be able to target someone else for the NK and be guaranteed that we&#039;ll lynch a guard the next day, doing their work for them.<br /><br />But honestly, Narwhal hasn&#039;t been striking me as so wolfy. <br /><br />He doesn&#039;t strike me as guard-y either though, so I won&#039;t complain if he&#039;s lynched. Kinda funny that this is turning into a narwhal/guy feud after all :p<br /><br />I feel like this game is going to change dramatically each time we lose a guard though. The relative stakes will be very different, especially when we&#039;re down to the last one, not to mention if we lose all the guards.<br /><br />This will be tough, I really have no idea who to trust right now.

				I agree with deathbutt that there is nothing special about a narwhal-guy fight. Two wolves rarely fight so bluntly and brutally, but there&#039;s no reason two humans can&#039;t.<br /><br />Trientalis, you still misunderstand the three list: The three are phil, guy, you, in that order.<br /><br />I&#039;m OK with a Narwhal lynch because he looks like a nonguard from a psychological standpoint. I think an availability-of-information standpoint is better than that though.<br /><br />Once I can see a vote count/deadline, I&#039;ll think about switching to Phil. I think we&#039;ve had a great day one.

				I am being aggressive mainly because I hate being told flat out that I am wrong about that stupid list time and time again. I am saying nothing wrong about it. <br /><br />1. It started because Phil, and I were saying that the flavor text made it sound like eep got to pick her guards, and then guy disagreed. <br />2. eep decided that the way that we resolved the problem led her to some information about us (Phil and guy are not guards, I may still be a guard).&nbsp; <br />3. guy made a list<br /><br />There is no reason other than that fight that we should be on a list, and it aggravates me more than anything that iron keeps telling me I&#039;m wrong about it. Go reread the thread, Iron. <br /><br />I find it to be faulty reasoning to be basing all information on this list.

				Do I really have to say all the things I&#039;m about to say?<br />Fine. <br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m a vanilla. I am fairly strongly convinced at this point that guy is a wolf. Me being a guard is totally out of the question (I&#039;m not a guard), and there just isn&#039;t a scenario where me being a wolf makes sense.<br />First of all, here I am, on the lynching block. Was I forced into this corner? No my friends, I fairly heavy-handedly maneuvered myself quite willingly into this postiion. I hinted strongly at an intentional vanilla lynch, and here I am. Would a wolf pull a D1 gambit like this just to gun for guy, someone who eep believes is almost certainly not a guard? That makes no sense. <br /><br />Guy has been persuasive. <br />Guard claims are, barring exotic role claims, essentially the only, by far the strongest, anti-lynch ammunition the wolves have. Don&#039;t even fucking argue with me about this. Who has fought tooth and nail to preserve it and put it on a pedestal? Hint: it wasn&#039;t me. Guy has been buying the wolves as much wiggle room as possible. Perhaps this results in a guard not getting lynched, and provides minor benefits to the human side in this way. But <span class="bbc_u">the wolves don&#039;t need to lynch guards.</span> Especially ones who claim. <br /><br />If one of Guy and I is a wolf, it is obvious as fuck it isn&#039;t me. Look at the way I have been playing. It has not been a winning strategy. Give me some credit, for goodness&#039; sake. There is no reward for the wolves if I am one of them. <br /><br />Now if you guys decide you want to trade lynches, that&#039;s fine. Vanilla for wolf is more than good for us, and I would be very much in favor of it. I&#039;ll enjoy watching the game. But you guys tend to have short memories when it comes to tomorrow&#039;s lynch. Do NOT let that happen. <br /><br />I&#039;ll keep my post on phil to maintain the tie (I trust eep), but if it breaks down I&#039;m voting for guy.

Was I forced into this corner? No my friends, I fairly heavy-handedly maneuvered myself quite willingly into this postiion. I hinted strongly at an intentional vanilla lynch, and here I am. Would a wolf pull a D1 gambit like this just to gun for guy, someone who eep believes is almost certainly not a guard?

There is no reward for the wolves if I am one of them. <br /><br />Now if you guys decide you want to trade lynches, that&#039;s fine. Vanilla for wolf is more than good for us, and I would be very much in favor of it. I&#039;ll enjoy watching the game. But you guys tend to have short memories when it comes to tomorrow&#039;s lynch. Do NOT let that happen. <br /><br />I&#039;ll keep my post on phil to maintain the tie (I trust eep), but if it breaks down I&#039;m voting for guy. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also... thems alots of big words Narwhal.. youz makin me feelz prettyyyy dumb<br /><br />Guy has not been buying wiggle room... he has been trying to preserve our guards.&nbsp; This is sounding pretty panicked to me... dont know bout you guys.

				Yall wake up. As you meet up, you realize dietcar is missing. You check his room to find a bloody mess. Dietcar is dead. Epp determines you must vote again in order to find the murdering. <br /><br />Dietcar is dead. Day 2 begins.<br /><br />Day 2 will end at 10PM on Sunday, as saturday night probably isn&#039;t a good time to end the day. <br />

His arguments about himself (that he&#039;d play smarter as a wolf?) are more incriminating than his arguments about the playstyle of the game (like not necessarily believing claimants).

				Epp, Kinda interesting to compare your notes to mine.<br /><br />1. AngryNarwhal-D1 Lynched- big dick, fuck him, probably wolf<br />2. Epp- Our glorious leader, positively human<br />3. Guy-very active, play style seems normal, but he usually tends to conceal wolf well, could go either way<br />4. Reaper- hasn&#039;t said much, saved my ass d1, probably vanilla<br />5. Modi-Not really striking me as anything in particular, but made good points, may be dangerous. isn&#039;t coming off as vanilla, but not necesarily a guard.<br />6. AJ-Inactive, not enough data, didn&#039;t cast a vote d1<br />7. Iron- Seemed to want me dead, tends to defer votes to eep, positively human<br />8. Dietcar- N1 killed- Seems guardy, first to hint at seer, chages votes to maintain the epptatorship, but earlier stated we shouldn&#039;t let epp call all the shots<br />9. Phil-Non guard human, easily the best player in the game.<br />10. Deathbutt- Gut says he&#039;s non vanilla, nothing to support this, seems to be staying kinda neutral, maybe trying to keep his head down?<br />11. Big Bird- Seemed really focused on narwhal, and was pretty narrow sighted about it, doesn&#039;t seem terribly human to me.<br />12. Trientalis- Assumed non-guard human, doesn&#039;t seem like much of a leader, but more a follower. small chance of wolf.

				One difficulty for the humans in this game is that a great human strategy is to keep your head low.<br /><br />That&#039;s also an OK wolf strategy - maybe not as good? Looking at votes yesterday I cannot really find anyone who manipulated votes other than those who tried to maintain the tie. Maybe Reaper, I think it was, who moved it onto Narwhal? If we ever find out that Narwhal was not a wolf this is a good thing to look into again, but today I don&#039;t really feel like Reaper is particularly wolfy.

				He mentioned something about a seer d1, and I personally hadn&#039;t put much thought into non-guard human roles, maybe I was just had tunnel vision, based on the odd rules in this game. If you took my note as him making a claim at seer, I apologize.

				Just kidding! Apparently I have free time now while I wait for something to thaw. So! Let&#039;s go through the game again and take slightly more detailed notes (with citations!)<br /><br />1. AngryNarwhal - was pretty chill about everyone joking about lynching him early game.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- &quot;No one is going to claim guard&quot; because &quot;claiming guard would prove them a wolf.&quot; [3] (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44065.html#msg44065) In retrospect, this is only true for a wolf claiming guard, and makes sense given how his claim last game went down.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Despite his initial objections to my idea re: lynching a volunteer if we got a claimant, narwhal suggests that we should just outright lynch a volunteer, no claimant necessary. <del></del> (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44131.html#msg44131)<br />2. Epp<br />3. Guy - was down for a &quot;spiteful killing&quot; early in day 1 [2] (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44054.html#msg44054)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- seems significantly less irritated at bigbird for agreeing with narwhal, than he was at narwhal in the first place. <del></del> (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44114.html#msg44114)<br />4. Reaper - very inactive; first remark d1 was that mass claiming was a bad idea. [4] (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44089.html#msg44089)<br />5. Modi<br />6. AJ<br />7. Iron<br />8. Dietcar - the hint of seer claim that phill picked up on is here (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44113.html#msg44113).<br />9. Phil - claimed narwhal was a psycho in his initial &quot;spy&quot; claim [1] (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44047.html#msg44047)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - keeps votin for AJ<br />10. Deathbutt - has been asking a lot of questions about guards -&gt; not guard?<br />11. Big Bird - uses a TONNE of ellipses. Thinks that massclaim is a bad idea. [5] (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44091.html#msg44091)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-but agrees with narwhal that we shouldn&#039;t spare guard claimants [6] (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44111.html#msg44111)<br />12. Trientalis<br /><br />mkay I have gotten bored with this. In any case, I&#039;m voting for <strong>Phil</strong> again.

				To be clear, though: it isn&#039;t weird that he agreed with narwhal at one point, it&#039;s weird that he agreed with narwhal at one point, and then suggested that narwhal was wolfy for the same reason.<br /><br />Yes, they were less adamant, but also, we totally lack information on almost half the players and that is bad.

				I have seen some evidence against Phil (slightly contradictory labels), but not altogether a whole lot. I didn&#039;t get the impression that he was putting a lot of effort into not getting lynched yesterday, though it&#039;s possible that he was simply confident his allies (Reaper?) were helping him out.<br /><br />I do think that if Reaper is a wolf, it is likely that Phil is as well, but I certainly wouldn&#039;t commit to that.<br /><br />We&#039;ve discussed inactivity a lot this game, and I agree that it has interesting new ramifications in this game. If AJ is a guard, we can&#039;t lynch him for being inactive like we usually try to do at some point, at least not without pressuring him to give us some evidence. On the other hand, wolves know that being inactive is a potentially good strategy for guards, and may be able to exploit that.<br /><br />I&#039;m on spring break now, so I should be hanging around more often.

				First of all sorry for not inserting a quote for this but I am posting from my phone to remain active... in response to me &quot;agreeing&quot; with marshal... it was more of trying to keep an open mind... it was not until he got very drastic about flatout lynching guard claims that I began to start the lunch proposal on him.

I do agree that we have very little against Phil at the moment, and I think we ought to be able to make a fairly well informed decision tonight. Phil remains a <em>safe</em> vote, but we still want to lynch a psycho if we can. <br /><br />The wolves can be clever, though. There could very well be a wolf vote on Narwhal, even if Narwhal was a wolf. If there are three wolves, then only myself, Narwhal, Epp, Iron, Dietcar, and Trient voted for other people. Azrael did not vote. Epp is a confirmed human, and Narwhal and Dietcar are both dead, which leaves Iron, Trient, and Azreal (excluding myself, obviously - I suppose this logic does not apply as well to everyone&#039;s perspectives). So if Narwhal wasn&#039;t a wolf, then all three of those must be wolves, which seems highly unlikely, and even if he was, most of the possible pairings between those three don&#039;t seem very feasible. We can draw speculation from this, perhaps, but there was probably at least one wolf on Narwhal.<br /><br />The order of the votes matters. If it looks like a hopeless case, a wolf could vote for kindred just to appear to be on the opposite team as that person. This wasn&#039;t a particularly hopeless case, though, so I&#039;m not sure why a wolf would vote for Narwhal.

				Ok... this is a BIT of a stretch but I&#039;m just brainstorming.... is it possible that Reaper could have voted for Narwhal (who lets just say, hypothetically, that he is a wolf in this situation) hoping to make things seem less obvious in the future that they were BOTH wolves (i.e. he would have ammunition later in case Narwhal DID die to say &quot;hey I voted for Narwhal so I couldn&#039;t be on his wolf side&quot;)&nbsp; And then seeing that the votes were stacked against Narwhal he switched to Phil knowing that Eep would choose Phil in the case of a tie leaving Narwhal free to live?...<br />Just a thought.

				Since I honestly can&#039;t tell whether big bird is being a noob human or getting his lies mixed up, I&#039;m going to give some advice: if you are having problems sorting out the details of the game, take some notes before making a post. Don&#039;t drop off the map entirely, but figure out some sort of strategy or point that you want to make before you say something in the thread. I would rather see fewer organized and coherent posts than lots of stream-of-consciousness posts that require some effort to parse.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44577.html#msg44577">Quote from: bigbird on March 08, 2013, 09:34:49 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Damn this is annoying, I&#039;m not looking for ANYONE to kill.

				@ bigbird, re: that your high level of activity does not indicate that you are a wolf. That may be obvious to you, but the entire game, for the rest of us, is figuring that out. We have no idea which side you&#039;re on, and we only have the little hints that we get in your posts. Some players post a lot of fluff as a wolf but not a human, others do the opposite. Especially since you&#039;re a new player, we need to judge that for ourselves. We can&#039;t just take your word for it, because relies on the assumption that you&#039;re a human trying to represent your human playstyle to us.

				My instinct tells me that Big Bird is simply being a noob, but that could be a newbie human OR a newbie wolf, so it only does him a slight credit. Basically, it&#039;s just hard to tell with him because we don&#039;t know his typical playstyle PLUS his playstyle has not developed fully. I am hesitant to vote him without more concrete evidence.

It&#039;s not a matter of simply trying to stay under cover and reach dominance through numbers. They have to do a great deal of hunting to try to find the guards in a sea of vanillas (and eep) trying to protact their guards. If I HAD to guess why Danny was killed it was because they thought he, out of all players, was likely a guard. There may have been some other reasons (day voting, interaction with others) but these would be secondary to their primary goal of selecting a guard. They can dissect the day any which way, but they CANNOT win until the guards are gone, and they can NK eep. The longer they dawdle, the longer they spend not winning. I&#039;ve been going through the game with the assumption we are dealing with four wolves, because this game seems very tipped in our favor unless they have considerable numbers.

It&#039;s not a matter of simply trying to stay under cover and reach dominance through numbers. They have to do a great deal of hunting to try to find the guards in a sea of vanillas (and eep) trying to protact their guards. If I HAD to guess why Danny was killed it was because they thought he, out of all players, was likely a guard. There may have been some other reasons (day voting, interaction with others) but these would be secondary to their primary goal of selecting a guard. They can dissect the day any which way, but they CANNOT win until the guards are gone, and they can NK eep. The longer they dawdle, the longer they spend not winning. I&#039;ve been going through the game with the assumption we are dealing with four wolves, because this game seems very tipped in our favor unless they have considerable numbers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Regarding being too cautious about the guards, I suppose I mostly mean this in the context of inactives. I&#039;ve been thinking about whether it&#039;s really true that inactives are more valuable to team human this game than in other games.

				I&#039;m reminded of the alleged trend for the 3rd person to pile a vote on a specific player to be a wolf, and noting that this trend is proving entirely worthless this game; the only three players who have held that spot on any bandwagon have been phil, narwhal, and bigbird.<br /><br />and this has been the general pattern all game, hasn&#039;t it? practically nobody has done anything decidedly wolfy, but nobody&#039;s done anything decidedly humany, either; and where there might be evidence one way or the other, there are just a lot of loops that can&#039;t possibly indicate the sort of information we might hope for.<br /><br />Just as a sort of conceptual question, though: at what point in the game does chaos cease to help team human? We&#039;re in an acceptable position right now; we have 3+ guards alive and 9 players who are pretty much totally unknown to us. At what point in the game does it become necessary to eliminate the chaos, just so that we stand a chance of knowing what&#039;s going on?

				So, notably, everyone but AJ voted in yesterday&#039;s lynch, and all of those people except for Trientalis and Dietcar were voting for one of (Phil, Narwhal). Dietcar&#039;s reasons for this were pretty obvious: he wanted to have a tie and leave the decision to a known human, but Trientalis&#039;s reasons seem to be just a desire to lay low/not get involved with the major conflict.<br /><br />There were four votes on Phil at the end of the day: Modi, Narwhal, me, and Iron. While there was a pretty decent case against narwhal, this distribution of votes suggests that 4 wolves is unlikely, unless narwhal was not one of them. It&#039;s possible that he was just getting bussed by his teammates d1, but I can&#039;t help but notice the trend for a lot of the players who piled up on narwhal to be doing relatively little scumhunting, and players who sort of stopped making any sort of case against anyone once narwhal had been lynched.

				Ok here is mine... I think that the NK on Dietcar says alot.&nbsp; He was the only one voting for Trientalis by the end of the day.&nbsp; And the only things she has said today are to defend herself... nothing that benefits our situation or brings us closer to finding a lynch... I think she along with the other wolves are keeping there heads down and popping in when they need to defend themselves.

				Not a terrible theory, but I don&#039;t buy it. It seems like too much of a rookie move. I don&#039;t know how much Tri has played, but from my understanding most people here are pretty well versed players. So the other wolves would likely overthrow a decision to make a move like that.

				The lack of posts here is rather sad. I feel a lot of tension going on between Phil and bigbird which leads me to believe that either they are just vanilla humans who are making guesses on who is suspicious or one of them is a wolf trying to save themselves. Phil has already said he was a vanilla the first day, but who knows, that could mean vanilla wolf. I&#039;m not really sure who to vote for today. I&#039;ve been trying to gather as much information as I could throughout the day, but really, where are the other players?? I don&#039;t know who of Phil or bigbird seems more suspicious to me, and no one else has really said much to lead to any kind of conclusions about them. I really don&#039;t want to just go for an inactive because that would most likely be a better chance at hitting a guard, but it may also lead to hitting a wolf. The mechanics of this game plus inactivity make it rather difficult to place votes.

				I think there is a <em>bit</em> more of a case against bigbird than against Phil, but I can&#039;t tell what parts of that are on account of him being a new player and what parts are genuine shadiness.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually going to vote for <strong>Modi</strong>, because I don&#039;t feel like he lays low like this as a human, and I&#039;ve gotten a generally slightly wolfy vibe from him.

				It&#039;s peculiar because they were the only ones to do it both days, and it happened in a very similar way both times. To be honest, though, we might be better off leaving the wolves to shuffle through the inactives. It&#039;s probably where most of the guards are.<br /><br />I agree with death butt about trient, though. I think it&#039;s also the case that wolves tend to have a certain type of cautiousness when it comes to casting votes that humans don&#039;t often exhibit, as if they want to wait for the right moment to act on their suspicions.

				To rely on information outside of the thread (which is kinda lame but if you aren&#039;t going to play, it&#039;s all I really have to work with), he said that he wasn&#039;t posting in here because it required too much thinking compared to other things. While he&#039;s sometimes inactive as a wolf, he doesn&#039;t seem to have a problem with pushing lynches on people/being active when he really has to and, as a result, is normally more active as a wolf (or at least less likely to suggest that he has game-related reasons to be inactive). So, from this I conclude that he is human.<br /><br />As for being a guard, it&#039;s the only way I can really explain his choice to be as inactive as he is, despite the fact that he seems to be online/available to some degree. So, yeah, I&#039;m pretty confident that he&#039;s a guard.

				Yeah I just assumed the time is why people aren&#039;t posting. If not, no reason to extend.<br /><br />But you must admit the current voting situation is not exactly fear-inspiring for any wolves. Everything is extremely spread out with no hope of consolidating. Wolves can create whatever sort of tie situation is most advantageous for them. It&#039;s terrible and it is getting worse.<br /><br />My best voting choices for changing that are bandwagonin&#039; on Tri or creatin&#039; a tie on AJ? That&#039;s the worst. <br /><br />It&#039;s not just my vote either. With 5 hours to go we find ourselves divided as to which inactive to lynch or who was most defensive. <br /><br /><br />What else do we have on Tri other than a) defensive and b) Some motivation to lynch Dieter? That is perhaps slightly better than voting for inactivity at best.<br /><br />I guess it feels like choosing between a bunch of really similar lynch candidates. Maybe the best thing to do is let Eep decide again, &#039;cause we at least know she&#039;s not a wolf. But that&#039;s also a defeatist attitude. <br /><br />I will confirm my vote on <strong>AJ</strong> - he&#039;s not helping and if it comes down to it Eep can decide if she thinks one bandwagon wolfier than the other.<br /><br /><br /><br />I would also like to propose some sort of informal rule that Eep would throw her support behind - a cool advantage of having a leader. What if we <em>strongly recommend</em> that everyone places some firm votes and supporting reasoning early in the day, instead of late? Would that alleviate this voter spread at all? I advocate that it&#039;s worth a try. <br /><br />Also making decisions tonight would be pretty darn good.

				I think your biggest disadvantage, Tri, is that there is not much else presenting itself for lynch candidacy.<br /><br />It&#039;s really hard to push for an inactive to get lynched, because there are few arguments against them personally.<br /><br /><br />10 players. 7 are active. Exactly 3 are guards. ~3 are wolves. Eep is the leader. <br /><br />Lynch a non-eep player at random. You have a ~33% chance of hitting a wolf (assuming we have killed none) and exactly a 33% chance of hitting a guard. This is neat because it means we have exactly a 66% chance of hitting a nonguard. Furthermore, guards can claim (vanillas can&#039;t, wolves can but will be punished if it fails to work). <br /><br />Lynch an inactive player at random (AJ, Reaper, Modi). Those same ratios apply - 66% chance of not hitting a guard. Probably about 33% of hitting a wolf; same for guard. Guard can also speak up for themselves - if they don&#039;t, they weren&#039;t contributing anything but a number anyway. <br /><br />The only real risk is if someone like AJ is not reading, is a guard, and gets lynched before claiming. We&#039;ll still know he was a guard, but too late to save him. Not too late to use the info.<br /><br /><br /><br />So in this game, where lying low is rather different than usual, perhaps we have more incentive than normal to hit an inactive (something I&#039;m usually in favor of anyway). That said, lynching someone who you really think is a wolf is obviously way better, so if your gut screams Tri or Phil, that&#039;s fine too.

				To be honest, I don&#039;t know that it would bother me to force a guard claim today; we would at least have someone to grill/focus the game a bit more.<br /><br />I get the definite impression that the night kill had less to do with who dietcar was suspicious of (he obviously wasn&#039;t suspicious ENOUGH to try to push a lynch on trient), and more to do with him seeming the part of guard (or possibly seer if it exists).<br /><br />My assessment on guy is that he has been jumping around on all of the players and just generally contributing to a feeling of uncertainty in the game. While there are benefits to obscuring the identity of the guards from the wolves, guy is just doing some outright strange things: for instance, suggesting that iron is being helpful and trying to lay low in one post, and then coming back a day later and saying that iron isn&#039;t really doing anything differently from all of the other players. It&#039;s almost like people are trying to find the hypocrites rather than the wolves.<br /><br />Let&#039;s consider, then, what it would mean if narwhal IS a wolf (for which we have decent evidence). That would make our pool of likely other wolves (modi, trient, iron), for these are the players who did not push votes for him. Oddly, these are also all people connected to iron in some way. Death butt might also be one of these, but I actually feel fairly confident that he is not a wolf.<br /><br />All in all, I don&#039;t find trientalis to be a bad lynch, but I would, perhaps, prefer to lynch one of the people contributing to chaos. Or maybe I&#039;ll just leave that to the wolves.<br /><br />Edit: especially because she&#039;s suggesting that we might as well just lynch her; that would seem to suggest, again, that she is not a guard. Not the greatest lynch, but also not the worst.<br /><br />Edit again: apparently that&#039;s another vanilla claimant for the pile. welp. :/

				Tri&#039;s point about Reaper isn&#039;t real bad though. We should definitely consider him in the future. <br /><br />a) Inactive<br />b) Opportunistic; snipes suspicion.<br />c) Sniped Narwhal away from a tie that eep breaks<br /><br /><br />None of those are wolf-only traits, but they could all feasibly help wolves.

				I&#039;m not convinced that humans will win at this point. Everyone seems fine with killing off vanilla humans. Kill off enough of them and the game can easily go to the wolves. Lets say that Narwhal was a vanilla human, that&#039;s one vanilla gone. Then Dieter was killed off. He was pretty much guaranteed to be human because he was night killed and we got nothing saying that he was a guard.&nbsp; If that is two vanillas gone, and if you kill me off today then you are down three vanillas, and will likely be four unless the wolves hit a guard tonight.&nbsp; So then if you are down four players that are vanilla, you will have three guards, about three wolves, eep and one vanilla human. I highly doubt at this point that the wolves would night kill me, as it would confirm me human.&nbsp; So actually that might give them more chance of hitting a guard. So I guess if you kill me off, that will just give the wolves a better chance at hitting a guard, but if you don&#039;t kill me off, they have the same chance because like I said, they will most likely not kill me off tonight.&nbsp; We should aim for someone who seems most likely wolf. I&#039;ll do more researching and try to come up with the best wolf candidate that I can.

Reaper was inactive, but just active enough to be a game changer.&nbsp; Then I said that I was going to tell what my role is if it became a pressing issue. It did. I think it would be a bad idea to try to kill me off today because then we are just losing ground. If we hit a wolf today, then we are getting closer to something. <br /><br />I could go ahead and force a tie by putting my vote on AJ, but really, I am kind of weary of just killing off someone we know NOTHING about because who knows what he is. If we kill him off and find out he is a guard, then we really will be in trouble. But he also could be a wolf. If he is, he&#039;s not being real helpful to his partners, so I feel like he is really someone that we should not be so willing to lynch today.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				It is my role. I&#039;m not going to just die peacefully as a vanilla human, or else I&#039;m not being helpful to the human team at all. They will just go, oh I hope she was a wolf after I&#039;m dead. It is more helpful to the human team if they can reevaluate what I said in the past if they know that I am a human. You can trust me or not, but I honestly am trying to win this game for the humans. It&#039;s really hard to do such a thing. We are all too afraid to kill off anyone but vanillas because it is too hard to pick out the guards and wolves at this point.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping to narrow things down a little bit.

Then, I, as the last remaining human and decider of ties, lynch the remaining guard claimant.<br /><br />Are there any problems with this?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> I need to work through the numbers here...<br /><br />Worst case scenario:<br />8 people:<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 2 vanilla claims<br />-- 5 unknown (3 guards 2 wolves)<br /><br />lynch vanilla, lose guard, 6 left<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 1 vanilla claim<br />-- 4 unknown (2 guards 2 wolves)<br /><br />lynch vanilla, lose guard, 4 left<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 3 unknown (1 guard 2 wolves)<br /><br />lynch guard, lose eep. :(<br />OR<br />lynch wolf, lose guard, 2 left, eep breaks tie and we win.<br /><br />So is there a way to guarantee we don&#039;t lynch a guard if there are currently two wolves alive? If so, then yeah I&#039;m all for this. If not I think we should think about it some more.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is assuming that the two vanilla claims are true... we should not just write off the people that claimed vanilla as for sure being vanilla.

				Nice, Phil claims seer for realsies. I fucking hope he&#039;s not insane (gets incorrect views all or some of the time).<br /><br />I claim guard. I do not have any powers, nor do I know who the other guards are. Phil is a lying wolf.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to figure out the logic of what Phil is trying to do and how we should proceed from here. I was thinking that perhaps we should test Phil&#039;s claim that he&#039;ll die in the night and then lynch him if he doesn&#039;t. Unfortunately just by announcing that plan it becomes useless since if he were telling the truth then obviously the wolves would leave him alive so that we lynch him tomorrow.<br /><br />The wolves won&#039;t kill me either since that would only serve to confirm me, so I&#039;ll probably be the last guard left alive.<br /><br />Once course of action might be to lynch Trientalis. That way we don&#039;t force more vanilla/guard claims today, so the wolves have another chance to miss (if all the vanillas claim then the wolves will know who to target). Then tomorrow we can lynch Phil, continuing in the strategy of not outing vanillas/guards (and lynching a wolf or at the very least insane seer).<br /><br />Then on D5 we will be down, in the worst case scenario, to<br />4 people:<br />-- 1 epp<br />-- 1 guard claim<br />-- 2 unknown (worst case 2 wolves)<br /><br />Then we lynch one of the two unknowns. If the remaining wolf killed me that night they would seal their own fate, so they&#039;d leave me alive.<br />3 people:<br />-- 1 epp<br />-- 1 death butt<br />-- 1 wolf<br /><br />Then eep has the unenviable choice between myself and the wolf. <br /><br />Not a bad play Phil, you put us in a tough spot, perhaps getting yourself out of one. If your last wolf can keep themselves alive until D6 you stand a decent chance where before you were kinda screwed.

				1) Having a Seer in this game would greatly sway the game in the human&#039;s favor if the Seer is on the Human side.<br />2) We have no way of knowing whether your instances of &quot;seeing&quot; are true or reverse... at this point there would be no harm in lynching you because there is a 50/50 chance of you being right, even by being a seer<br />3)Claiming seer right now will not benefit the humans, the wolves will not kill you because there would be obvious turmoil figuring out whether you are in fact a seer or not and we will most likely make more harmful decisions when we stop using our common sense and just listen to someone claiming seer... the wolves will have a field day in this chaos.<br /><br />Lynch Phil

				I was initially inclined to believe that Phil was just being a desperate wolf, but there were a lot of things he did that indicate, if nothing else, that he had this claim in mind for a very long time. The timing was curious; just when I suggested that we lynch all of the vanillas, he comes out with this view. Perhaps I should have just waited longer to make my suggestion, though. On the other hand, he has been suggesting from early on in the game that we have 4 wolves, and seemed to jump at death butt&#039;s joke that he was a seer. I took that as more of a fake claim than a real claim, but hoped that it would distract the wolves from killing a guard (if there is one). There are other oddities: none of the other non-guards have claimed a role (but perhaps they have just not had a chance).<br /><br />On the other hand, we have death butt. I was inclined to believe that he was human, but (1) he took waaaay too long to form any sort of response to phil&#039;s accusation and (1a) even when he did, he dawdled too long on the idea that &quot;maybe this is a fake seer.&quot; (2) He had an immediate defender in bigbird. (3) He seemed to believe that Phil&#039;s claim regarding Iron confirmed Phil&#039;s seer powers <em>before Iron said anything to confirm/deny his guard status</em>. Both death butt and bigbird also seem to be skipping over an obvious possibility here: that phil claimed his wolf partner is a guard in order to protect him.<br /><br />In any case, if we lynch <strong>death butt</strong>, we know for sure whether phil is lying. And if Phil is lying, then Iron is likely to be a wolf as well. And then we can figure things out from there.

(1a) And Phil seems to be spending negative time on this concept. <br /><br />(2) Didn&#039;t surprise me.

I didn&#039;t really consider it very much either, though it still doesn&#039;t seem particularly likely. Nor does it seem so important to think about right now.<br /><br />Lynching me is a really bad idea. I suggest you at least consider lynching a vanilla or something, like I was talking about before.

				Okeydokey. Dont&#039; think complete silence benefits me any more.<br /><br />I won&#039;t say if I&#039;m guard or not. Let the wolves play WIFOM with that&nbsp; :winky:. <br /><br />If Phil is a wolf, we do not know if he is seer - this is actually independent of what my role is. Get this:<br />Depending on whether 1, 2, or 3 wolves live, he has a 50, 60, or 75% chance of guessing my role aright. <br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">7 uncertain players<br />3 are guards<br />1, 2, or 3 are wolves<br />3/6 = 50%, 3/5 = 60%, 3/4 = 75%.</div></div>The vanilla claims under pressure make these odds even better by giving more info. <br /><br />So, if I had immediately backed up his claim about me because he happened to guess right, the wolves get two guards. Note that they automatically lose Phil if he&#039;s a wolf - deathbutt&#039;s guardianship is revealed. This means it&#039;s less likely Phil would have picked a wolf as his backup too - a reason you might believe I&#039;m not on Phil&#039;s team. He has little to gain calling on me for support as a wolf.<br />If he guesses wrong, he still trades exactly one wolf for a guard, and the wolves have only 5 uncertain players going into the night - and up to 3 of those uncertain players are wolves.<br /><br />If we lynch no guards, we couldn&#039;t lose until Night 6, or even Night 7 if the wolves have bad luck. That&#039;s not to say we can never lynch a guard claimant of course, just that if in doubt, we can often err on the side of saving a guard.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t feel like there&#039;ll be special roles but I don&#039;t have any Haploic hints to support that.<br /><br />So, though I know nothing about deathbutt, I fear a scenario similar to his more than I fear deathbutt as a wolf. Might be a good idea to kill deathbutt later if more doubts arise.<br /><br />We don&#039;t necessarily need to kill Phil immediately to foil his plan if he is a wolf, but if we&#039;re gonna kill him and deathbutt anyway...<br /><br /><br />I might rather investigate some other claims that have been made. Another post to come.

I fucking hope he&#039;s not insane (gets incorrect views all or some of the time).<br /><br />I claim guard. I do not have any powers, nor do I know who the other guards are.

I was thinking that perhaps we should test Phil&#039;s claim that he&#039;ll die in the night and then lynch him if he doesn&#039;t. Unfortunately just by announcing that plan it becomes useless since if he were telling the truth then obviously the wolves would leave him alive so that we lynch him tomorrow.<br /><br />The wolves won&#039;t kill me either since that would only serve to confirm me, so I&#039;ll probably be the last guard left alive.<br /><br />Once course of action might be to lynch Trientalis.

Same with bigbird; the waffling and the distancing from a person he seems to be supporting just don&#039;t strike me as a human thing to do.<br /><br />And I&#039;m not too worried. All of these shenanigans have pretty much confirmed one player as a vanilla human, and that&#039;s all I really want for tonight.

				Whoops, I miscounted last night. Lynching me is only an auto-lose if there are three wolves alive, which is far from impossible. If there are two wolves alive then we&#039;ll go to the scenario I posted where eep has to choose one wolf from three players, none of whom will be claiming guard. So, just a 66% chance of losing.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler: Lynch death butt (flip guard)" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"> guard NK&#039;d. 6 alive<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 1 confirmed wolf (phil)<br />-- 4 unknown (1 guard, 1-2 wolves, 1-2 vanillas)<br /><br />Lynch Phil, guard NK&#039;d. 4 alive<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 3 unknown (1-2 wolves, 1-2 vanillas)<br /><br />2 wolves left means humans lose, 1 wolf means humans have 33% chance.</div></div><br />Now I wonder what the scenario looks like if you all lynch me and I don&#039;t flip guard (won&#039;t happen but you guys will be wanting to consider this possibility).<br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler: Lynch death butt (no flip)" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"> guard NK&#039;d. 6 alive<br />-- 1 epp<br />-- 1 confirmed seer <br />-- 1 vanilla claim<br />-- 3 unknown (2 guards, 1 wolf)<br /><br />Lynch vanilla claim, guard NK&#039;d. 4 alive<br />-- 1 epp<br />-- 1 confirmed seer<br />-- 1 wolf<br />-- 1 guard</div></div><br />At this point Phil has viewed either the wolf or the guard and so humans win. As Phil says; if he&#039;s a real seer then lynching me means essentially guaranteed human victory. But it also means potential guaranteed wolf victory or potential 66% chance of wolf victory. Personally I don&#039;t think it would seem worth it to me even if I didn&#039;t know that I&#039;m a guard.<br /><br />That leaves us the option I proposed before Phil&#039;s claim, lynching vanilla claims. We could start with Trient so that Phil can view more people.<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler: Lynch Trient" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"> guard NK&#039;d. 6 alive<br />-- 1 epp<br />-- 1 guard claim<br />-- 1 seer claim<br />-- 3 unknown (1-2 guards, 0-2 wolves, 0-2 vanillas)<br /><br />At this point Phil will have viewed one of the three unknowns. If he is a wolf that means that he knows who the last guard is. If he is a human that means there are two guards and either a wolf or a vanilla among the unknowns, one of which he has viewed.<br /><br />If we lynch a guard and there are two wolves we auto-lose, so we can&#039;t risk that. That leaves Phil and anyone else who claims vanilla; we can lynch either one.<br /><br />Lynch non-guard, guard NK&#039;d. 4 alive<br />-- 1 epp<br />-- 1 guard claim (me)<br />-- 2 unknown (1-2 wolves, 0-1 vanillas, 0-1 seers)<br /><br />If we don&#039;t have a vanilla claim at this point then we have two wolves and one guard and we&#039;re not in the best shape. There&#039;s a base 33% chance of lynching the guard and even if we do get a wolf, they won&#039;t NK the guard so eep will have to pick one of two options to decide the game.<br /><br />If we do have a vanilla claim then we can lynch them and be guaranteed to head into the final 50/50 round. </div></div><br />If I&#039;m right, this means that we can&#039;t guarantee better than a 50/50 chance of winning without choosing whether to trust me or Phil. But it also shows that we&#039;ll be worse off if you mistakenly trust him than if you choose to distrust both of us. The bad news for me is that I know it&#039;s going to be hard to not want to lynch me at some point. <br /><br />Iron, you make a lot of good points, but from my point of view Phil is almost certainly a wolf with seer powers. He obviously knew I was a guard and wanted to get me lynched so that the humans wouldn&#039;t just keep lynching vanillas (and him). That is also why I believed his claim about Iron; he clearly has seer powers and he clearly seemed to think that his claim would make Iron trust him. I wouldn&#039;t say I know you&#039;re a guard though, just that I suspect it. <br /><br />I think Phil is the best choice since his being a &#039;seer&#039; isn&#039;t hugely helpful; even if he&#039;s human and identifies more people, trusting him will always risk certain loss (unless the wolves fuck up again tonight). I don&#039;t think he will incriminate his teammates, either. He&#039;ll just add more chaos. Lynching him, on the other hand, doesn&#039;t hurt our chances at all and he has a higher chance of being a wolf than Trient. <br /><br />Lynching Guy would just force him to claim, which we don&#039;t want either.

				On second thought, what I suggested before is mathematically impossible; death butt, guy, and bigbird cannot all be on the same team.<br /><br />We currently have 8 players alive. One of those 8 is me, so we have 7 players unconfirmed. We know that we have 3 guards. We know that we have 2 players who have explicitly claimed non-guard. This is the situation if one more vanilla claims:<br /><br />We have 4 guard claimants (presumably) against 3 vanilla claimants. We lynch one vanilla claimant today. One guard claimant dies.<br />The next day: We have 3 guard claimants against 2 vanilla claimants. We lynch one vanilla claimant today. One guard claimant dies.<br />The next day: We have 2 guard claimants against 1 vanilla claimant. We lynch the last vanilla claimant today. One guard claimant dies.<br />The final day: We have 1 wolf against me. I decide all ties. Human victory.

				Well, I know that Phil will know who all the guards are for sure if we let him live tonight. The no outing vanillas thing isn&#039;t that huge of a deal, but if we lynch Phil it only seems to make sense to wait for the vanillas to out themselves tomorrow.<br /><br />Current situation, in my view:<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 1 guard (me)<br />-- 1 wolf (phil)<br />-- 1 vanilla claim (tri)<br />-- 2 guards (maybe iron)<br />-- 1-2 wolves (???)<br />-- 0-1 vanillas (???)<br /><br />If there is a hidden vanilla, I see no reason to out them. Trient is also not confirmed, so there may be as many as two hidden vanillas. To me the best course of action is to lynch Phil, then Trient, then other vanillas. What do we gain from vanilla claims now?<br /><br />We don&#039;t know if they can choose to night kill or not. That doesn&#039;t matter. For our purposes it would be ridiculously naiive to not consider, if not assume that they can choose.

				To answer my own question, the only advantage I can see to having a vanilla claim now is that we would be able to guarantee skipping the 33% chance of loss situation (see the Lynch trient spoiler on my earlier post) ahead of time if we go on the lynching vanillas route. I don&#039;t see that as a very big advantage because I know our best course of action is to start lynching non-guards anyway.

				I understand that lynching vanillas is appealing, but isn&#039;t that just helping the wolves do their job? As far as I can tell, Phil and I are the only ones who have claimed vanilla so far? Phil obviously is not vanilla. He&#039;s being rather chaotic for just some vanilla, he must have some kind of power and I&#039;m leaning towards wolf. So if you kill me, you are killing off one more human that the wolves no longer have to kill off. I know that there is nothing confirming me human and that it is really hard to get any kind of trust from people in a game of deception, but lynching me will just put the wolves closer to a win. <br /><br />If we don&#039;t lynch vanillas though, we have a higher chance of accidentally killing a guard. So understandable to just go for the vanillas but wouldn&#039;t that be what the wolves want? They want you to focus on the vanilla claims so that they can hide amongst the possible guards, kill off guards and then win the game.

				Why are you assuming this instead of asking: &quot;Haplo, are the wolves allowed to not make night kills? (Yes/No/Cannot fairly answer)&quot;<br /><br />Incidentally, I would like Haplo to answer that question if he can do so fairly.<br /><br />But, death butt, I feel like you&#039;re (1) deliberately presenting a situation which the wolves might not even have thought of as the only possible way the wolves will play the game and (2) providing some seriously bs reasoning to justify your initial slip-up that claimed Iron was a guard. That you and bigbird operated under the same assumption initially, coupled with bigbird&#039;s denial that he was defending you in attacking Phil, indicates to me that you are most likely a wolf.<br /><br />Given what other information we have, though; if Phil is telling the truth, then I can say with a fair amount of certainty that trientalis is the remaining wolf. There are other things that support this idea: yesterday, it was basically death butt&#039;s actions that saved trientalis from lynch.<br /><br />Would like Reaper (and perhaps others) to weigh in on the matter.

				The wolves&#039; job is trying to get us to lynch guards, not vanillas. Otherwise the numbers don&#039;t work out particularly well for them, even if there are three alive right now.<br /><br />At some point we may decide to lynch a guard claimant instead of a vanilla, but that needs to be undertaken with extreme caution. If we foul up we could very well lose.<br /><br />Eventually, unless one side or the other fucks up pretty bad, eep will have to make a decision between two or three players. Unless, that is, it turns out the wolves have to kill someone every night, in which case not lynching me would be the obvious course of action since lynching non-guards would guarantee a human victory.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1030.msg44942.html#msg44942">Quote from: epplant on March 12, 2013, 03:29:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Furthermore, if Phil is telling the truth, then the wolves, tonight, need to choose between killing a confirmed seer and killing a guard.

				Ah, you are right eep. For those who don&#039;t understand:<br /><br />Currently the consensus is:<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 2 non-guard claims<br />-- 1 guard claim<br />-- 4 unknowns (2-3 guards, 1-2 wolves, 0-1 vanillas)<br /><br />Lynch Phil, Guard NK&#039;d. 6 left, 2 guards<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 1 non-guard claim<br />-- 1 guard claim<br />-- 3 unknowns (1-2 guards, 1-2 wolves, 0-1 vanillas)<br /><br />Lynch Trient, guard NK&#039;d. 4 left, 1 guard<br />-- 1 eep<br />-- 1 guard claim<br />-- 2 unknowns (0-1 guards, 1-2 wolves, 0-1 vanillas)<br /><br />Vanillas (if any) claim and are lynched, guard is NK&#039;d, eep breaks tie.<br /><br />If no vanillas claim we know we have two wolves and one guard and eep has a 66% chance of picking a wolf. Then guard is NK&#039;d, eep breaks tie.<br /><br />So yes, <span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">we are guaranteed victory if a vanilla comes forward. Otherwise, we have a 66% chance of winning</span> if we do this plan. The order of lynching does not actually matter, I just prefer Phil because he&#039;s a wolf.<br /><br />I think any proponent of lynching me right now is dumb, even if everyone else claims guard. A guaranteed 66% chance is way better than an iffy 100% chance.<br /><br />Also mass claim doesn&#039;t hurt us in either scenario, so I fully endorse mass claim.

				Mathematically it makes no sense to lynch Deathbutt today. I can&#039;t agree more. <strong>Phil</strong>.

We can lynch deathbutt tomorrow and Phil today and have the same info (minus highly suspect seer views), but we can&#039;t lynch DB today and say the same thing.<br /><br /><br />All eep really says is that deathbutt COMES ACROSS wolfier than Phil; that&#039;s all I can see.

This also generously assumes we&#039;ve killed a wolf.<br /><br />&nbsp;Our biggest advantage is delaying the killing of a guard the longest we can afford to, until we really think we have a guard-claimant wolf. This should be obvious even without numbers, objectively (which is more what I mean by mathematically, I suppose).<br /><br />Even if you don&#039;t like the probability thing, you can still see from DB&#039;s decision trees that similar things will go down.<br /><br />TL;DR - More guards = longer survival = more chance of killing wolves. <br /><br />It makes SENSE to kill wolves that are not masquerading as guards unless you are VERY CONFIDENT, and I don&#039;t see why you&#039;d be so confident.<br /><br /><br />Basically everyone keeps assuming that I&#039;m a guard, so it&#039;s not weird that deathbutt did the same.

				the other thing is that if death butt/bigbord/trient are the wolves it would be p strange because they are all clumped together at the bottom of the list soooo~~~<br /><br />Here&#039;s a model, assuming phil, guy, and reaper to be the wolves, presently:<br /><br />2.

I&#039;d venture to guess guy is an additional one, (again I&#039;ve been assuming this was a 4 wolf game for a while, based on the rule-set. 3 guards and seer.

				Ok... I disagree with the idea of lynching all vanillas. I agree with Epp that we need to find the lying guard because any wolf in their right mind won&#039;t claim vanilla I THINK... also... I think I went a little too far earlier to say that I knew that Phil was a wolf... I guess what I meant to say is that him claiming seer REAAALLLY stunk to me. I dont like it nor anything it brings to our situation right now. Then it kind of went all downhill from there and I honestly was just defending my stance toward the end...

Human victory.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Obviously if we don&#039;t get a vanilla claim it will &quot;only&quot; be a 66% chance of winning. Not a bad deal if you ask me and all it requires is that you find it unlikely that there are four living wolves right now.<br /><br />The best part about this plan is that it doesn&#039;t risk accidentally lynching a guard, which is an automatic risk if you lynch guard claimants. Duh. Thing about lynching guards by accident is that we are pretty fucked if we do. I dunno what&#039;s so hard to understand about that. Even if there are only two wolves alive right now the best we can do is a 33% chance of winning if we hit a guard. And there is NO WAY for us to have more than a hunch about which guards are lying or not.

				intuitively, it doesn&#039;t make sense for eep to have chosen her guards and never has<br /><br />i had also always assumed that wolves got the guards pm info so that shit like what eep was doing couldn&#039;t happen, because that also makes sense for the host to do. otherwise the game is broken. the thing is though, eep was the only one doing it. and none of the guards seemed to catch on to why she was doing it, even though we were the ones she was basing it on (in terms of what information we had)<br /><br />anyway, yeah. maybe what i said was incriminating lol. originally, i wasn&#039;t paying attention to the flavor text or the gist of my pm. that was obvious by my reactions and the lack of knowledge of the shit in the first post. i was never told anything like eep picked her guards. i was told she doesn&#039;t know anything about that, and the idea of her increasing the number of guards seemed silly for the same reason but also because that seems overpowered<br /><br /><br />

				you&#039;d still prove a wolf in doing so<br /><br />it would only really make sense if you chose it to happen when a certain number of guards were gone (or not) and then it happened to a random vanilla or a predetermined vanilla<br /><br />i wasn&#039;t saying you ever suggested that.

				but if all the vanillas are gone, it has no effect either way. i remind you of your game, in which you used such a mechanism and we knew exactly who our mark was beforehand.<br /><br />it could also have some restriction regarding when i use it, which would yield a greater chance of hitting guard OR wolf if it were early game. if this is the case, trientalis is more likely to be a wolf (though there is little loss to lynching her anyways, tomorrow), and only she would know whether i am bluffing on this front.<br /><br />regardless, my question was, more fundamentally, about the information that death butt did or didn&#039;t have. I knew whether the guards had information about my mark or not. I figured that a guard would be more likely to rely on the information they were given, while a wolf would be more likely to make conjectures in an effort to appease, or stall while they asked haplo whether he had hidden any information from them.<br /><br />There are players this might not have worked on, and there was some chance of it giving an inaccurate impression. I probably would not have asked, say, bigbird the same question if he were the first to claim, but I figured it would work out well enough with death butt (and indeed, did not confirm him as wolf, which was what i was expecting/hoping for at the time).

				i don&#039;t think it would&#039;ve confirmed him as a wolf anyway, regardless of whether or not i had that information in the first place. i still feel the same way about it<br /><br />anyway guy can make mistakes too. and apparently when he does eep knows the whole game and doesn&#039;t want to play anymore. that&#039;s fun for everyone<br /><br />not wolf guy though lol

				So we know bigbird was a guard. He even claimed guard. I think the only people that we had as guard claims were death butt, guy, and Phil&#039;s supposed guard view of Iron.

				i never really claimed guard until day 3<br /><br />and if you think i&#039;m a wolf (not guard), it suggests both deathbutt and iron are guards. which means phil was a wolf. which means he thought iron was a guard the whole time. so why wasn&#039;t iron night killed either?<br /><br />also there&#039;s always been suspicion on me and lynching me has never been a far fetched possibility, so of course the wolves aren&#039;t going to night kill me. especially night 3, when eep is so sure i&#039;m wolf.

				yup, the nightkill is ambiguous and should not be used as evidence against guy, except that he was getting really irritated with bigbird so maybe he was the best choice<br /><br />if you want to be &quot;technical&quot; and ignore any other evidence, the best lychee would be trient, but it&#039;s kinda boring to win that way

				Why do you assume that lynching me would end in a win? There are 5 players left + eep. Of those 5 players what if two of them are still wolves? Here is how that situation may look:<br /><br />2 wolves<br />2 guards<br />1 vanilla<br />eep<br /><br />If you kill me then you are down to two guards, two wolves. wolves kill a guard tonight. <br /><br />2 wolves<br />1guard<br />eep<br /><br />eep has to figure out which one really is the guard who knows if she will be able to? Wolf win is still very possible. <br /><br />If there is only one wolf left, then the situation may look more like this:<br /><br />1 wolf<br />2 guards<br />2 vanillas<br />eep<br /><br />Kill me today, then you are down to a wolf, two guards and a vanilla.&nbsp; The wolf has a pretty good chance of hitting another guard as a night kill.&nbsp; There will be a wolf, a guard, a vanilla, and eep left the next day.&nbsp; This may or may not result in a win for the humans if the wolf is tricky enough. What if the wolf gets the guard to be lynched and there is one vanilla and eep left? eep will be night killed and wolves win. <br /><br />These are just a few scenarios, but I got the feeling that eep thinks this game is unwinnable for wolves. It still is going to take a lot of strategy for humans to win this game.

				So, we currently have<br /><br />(1) eep - confirmed human<br />(2) guy - claimed guard<br />(3) iron - claimed guard<br />(4) death butt - claimed guard<br />(5) trientalis - non-guard<br />(6) reaper - not really playing<br /><br />Suppose we lynch trientalis and let the wolves kill another guard. For the sake of argument, we&#039;ll make that iron. Then we have:<br /><br />(1) eep - confirmed human<br />(2) guy - claimed guard<br />(3) death butt - claimed guard<br />(4) reaper - no claim<br /><br />Basically, unless reaper claims vanilla at this point, the one remaining guard knows that the other two players are wolves, so it entirely falls on my judgement regarding who is/isn&#039;t a wolf. If reaper does claim vanilla, then we just lynch him, and I decide the tie the next day.<br /><br />which is why it would have been nice if reaper actually made a claim instead of just making a joke but enh whatever.<br /><br />in fact, i think i shall vote <strong>trientalis</strong> because i have other things to do and might as well take this route. because enh why not

				Yes, I did read your scenarios. But, as death butt pointed out, that is, raw, a 66% chance of humans winning.<br /><br />And if reaper claims vanilla, then we only have one wolf among the players claiming guard. And that&#039;s fine; if we begin a day with only me and a wolf, we automatically win, because i decide the tie.<br /><br />I&#039;m not exactly acting like this game means nothing to me, so much as I&#039;m disengaging myself from a process that will be draining without giving me much new information.

				Of the three people that we lynched, who do you think was a wolf? We killed Narwhal, AJ and Phil. If we had three wolves, at least one of the three that we killed was for sure a wolf. If there were only two total wolves in this game, I am not convinced that we hit any wolves yet. But, if there were only two wolves to start out with and we hit one, then we are in a somewhat better place.&nbsp; Who knows, we might have been incredibly lucky in a three wolf scenario and taken down two of them. I highly doubt that. Overall, we have only killed three players (the rest have been night kills which were pretty much definitely humans) and we have no idea how many wolves are still out there, well the wolves do I guess, but I still think two wolves might be likely.

				Another point I&#039;d like to make, Iron never claimed guard. He left the point ambiguous when Phil said that he was a guard.<br /><br />If Phil really was human, which is a possibility, then we should look at deathbutt heavily today. He was the person that Phil was pretty convinced was a wolf. I&#039;m not crossing either Iron or Death butt off of the list of possible wolves. I actually really feel like Reaper is making this game way more difficult by not playing at all. That is the main reason that I want to lynch him. He could be a wolf lying very low, or he could just be a human that doesn&#039;t care about playing for some reason, or he could be a guard trying to stay in the shadows and out of the battle. His ambiguity is hard to work with.&nbsp; I really would like to focus attention on either Iron or deathbutt even more. <br /><br />Let&#039;s assume that Phil really did have seer powers:<br />We know that deathbutt is a wolf. <br />We know that Iron is a guard. <br /><br />What if he was insane seer and saw the opposite alignment:<br />Deathbutt is a guard<br />Iron is a wolf<br /><br />This insane seer situation may also be another way that Iron and Phil may have been on the same team. They may both be wolves and Phil just basically cleared Iron because everyone is assuming that he is a guard now.<br /><br />Of Deathbutt and Iron, I&#039;m pretty sure one of them are a wolf.

				If we hit a wolf today, we might even win if there is only one left. If there are two left and we take one out today, then at least we took out one and then there is only one source of deception to deal with.

				We certainly can&#039;t do that two days in a row, though. If we do hit a guard today, it is actually much more to our advantage to lynch you tomorrow, and let the game wind down to a tie.<br /><br />Essentially, my thinking is that we can aim into the guard pile either today or tomorrow, but it&#039;s much less risky tomorrow.

				My vote stays on Trientalis; I&#039;m in accord with pretty much everything eep has been saying.<br /><br />Reaper, please claim. If you&#039;re human it can only help you.<br /><br />I understand wanting to go for a wolf today. Guy would be my pick since he&#039;s an actual guard claim and has been opposite me a lot and also advocating lynching guard claims. Only wolves want to lynch guard claims since that&#039;s their best method for winning. <br /><br />It&#039;s possible that Phil claimed seer because the wolves had a priest who saw a real seer die, possible he had the power, possible he made it up.

				What up bitches<br /><br /><br />Not being able to post much has helped me survive suspicion this long, but it won&#039;t help anymore. I am a guard.

He has been playing pretty normally from what I remember, but has been pretty aggressive<br /><br />The problem I have with deathbutt is that it&#039;s easy to claim guard and then basically say &#039;only wolves would want to lynch me&#039;.&nbsp; Also, Phil may have been human.

				Day 1 Dieter voted after deadline and it wasn&#039;t counted.<br /><br />While it is up to Haplo basically in this situation, I personally would lean towards the wolf win only because humans weren&#039;t even trying. If Iron believed himself human why would he have a different vote from Eep (the only other known to him) for like two whole days?

				I mean it would make one human one wolf tomorrow. Eep breaks the tie so the wolf gets killed? Sounds really unlikely...<br /><br />To be honest even if we award the lynch to the humans, it <em>still</em> seems like a wolf victory from a thematic point of view. Strictly by rules in that situation it would go to eep, but also strictly by the rules the wolves got the votes in on time.

				one action can have more that one perspective<br /><br />the wolves don&#039;t care which wolf you lynch, they care about winning. the only possible win they could have would be to control the vote, which would be caused by the extremely unlikely split vote from the humans. therefore they had to convince the humans, somehow, to split the vote. this is what happened.<br /><br />objectively, you changed your vote to reaper.<br /><br />you saw one wolf over another wolf. you were convinced to vote for a different wolf.<br /><br />they saw split vote. you were convinced to give iron or them control of the vote. iron didn&#039;t take it, so they successfully pulled off their only goal.

				that&#039;s the dumbest thing i&#039;ve ever heard<br /><br />if anything the fact that he did that so much is what caused the game to be so close in the first place. and he wouldn&#039;t have had to do that if haplo hadn&#039;t given extra information that could have caused a perfect game (or near perfect game) from the humans. if he had said next to nothing to help the humans (which is the opposite of what happened) and there was not suspicion on him from minute one, i suspect the game would have been a complete wash for the humans. they would have done probably nothing as far as i can tell, but instead two of the three wolves had to be on the defensive from RIGHT when the game started.

				at least on day 1, i think the wolves got put at a disadvantage because of poor play. it isn&#039;t that absurd, no matter what the set-up, to believe that the guards would know whether i knew their identity, and even if not, phil could have asked haplo rather than me. so i gave an ambiguous answer that made guard knowledge of this clear.<br /><br />guy was put in the spotlight because he misinterpreted my answer as &quot;yes, me and the guards know each other,&quot; became outraged because he thought haplo had fucked the balance, and responded as such. if he had stopped to notice the ambiguity of my response, or just kept quiet in thread and raged at haplo directly, then he wouldn&#039;t have been caught.<br /><br />they did a good job of saving after it happened, but i could have done this with any or no information in the right circumstances. bluffing, and the ability to respond to bluffs without outing yourself, is part of the game, on both sides.<br /><br />humans played poorly by not pushing for, at the very least, a Phil lynch early in the game.

PLAY THROUGH YOUR GAME a few times with many different scenarios to see what happens. a couple of test runs with semi-random votes would have found the tiebreaker issue in this game extremely quickly.<br /><br />i mean, it was a good attempt at fixing the &quot;ties&quot; problem (which we don&#039;t really have a good way around yet, but this also lets each host put their own mark on the game) but ended up being quite problematic.

				Yeah, mystic pretty much pointed out all of the problems already. I really should have had an odd number of players without a guardian, to prevent a wolf + eep tie at the end. I also shouldn&#039;t have told eep that the guard know they she doesn&#039;t know and also have not told the guards that. <br /><br />I intentional left it ambiguous about whether or not eep knew who the guards were cause i wanted to give her some things to play with. <br /><br />Roles were seer and guardian. I gave seer a little extra power in that she would see if a human player had a role, but not which role, as well as seeing if the player was a wolf. Guardian couldn&#039;t save eep. <br />I thought it was really funny when wolves killed off seer and then guardian N1 and N2.

I think the first problem here is that you&#039;re assuming most players assume something about the game. Maybe they didn&#039;t? And even if they did, most is still a problematic number, right? Even all-but-one provides extra evidence to certain players that the host didn&#039;t intend. Obviously at least one player didn&#039;t assume it since they asked, either in private (causing Haplo&#039;s answer?) or actually in the thread.<br /><br />I think most of us look down on using pm text as evidence and this is only like a step away from that. It should have been clarified in the rules (before the game start, preferably) or not at all. It drives away player-player interaction and instead to player-rule-player interaction, which I don&#039;t think anybody likes or wants.

				I disagree, mostly, with your analysis that it&#039;s a wolfy question. I can see how it would be useful (or at least less maddening) for a human and especially for a special to know. I do agree that perhaps directly asking the host is the better idea, of course, but I think people in general are not very likely to ask the host questions...<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t think fairly large groups of humans should have access to information that affects everyone, while no one else gets it. Even if it seems like trivial information. If he said to only the guards that there&#039;s no nightposting (for whatever reason) and someone asks if there&#039;s nightposting... I dunno. It draws unwanted attention to something I feel is silly.

				I honestly think the game would have been far smoother and Mystic would be less critical if we had played it right at all.<br /><br />Disagreement with guy aside, Day 1 produced a buttload of information. I don&#039;t regret getting lynched, it was still a good plan that was executed fairly well. But Day 2 the humans just sat there, except for Bigbird who didn&#039;t understand how to make the most of it. He&#039;s the only one I don&#039;t blame for D2. It went to waste and it was extremely frustrating. <br /><br />Eep really IMO bumbled pretty hard in the way she used the information she had. She would have been better off keeping it all secret and influencing things subtly. It really seemed like she only helped the wolves muddle things.

				i don&#039;t really want to turn the post-game discussion into everyone pointing fingers, but i do think there were a number of players who contributed to muddling up the game more than they seem to have realized.<br /><br />iron&#039;s point that the wolves were likely to have the guard PM was the only valid point regarding why i shouldn&#039;t have called out Phil/guy/trient. but this also lessened my resolve that i might have good reasons to push for lynching him, which was problematic d 2

				also having seer and guardian night killed night 1 and 2 isn&#039;t something to laugh at. aside from obviouslly tipping the balance in favor of the humans, it also makes it harder for wolves to discern who is guard, since seer and guardian are going to be acting differently too<br /><br />it should have at least been known that seer and guardian would be in the game<br /><br />also that way i could&#039;ve bitched about it earlier

				@guy<br />The way i see it, the wolves had an advantage over a normal game, in that they had an alternate win condition. They could still win by having a majority vote, like always. The game could have had a n2 win for wolves, while unrealistic, it is a possibility. That&#039;s why i gave humans a little extra power in their seer and tried to give eep some more tools to play with.

				No, you aren&#039;t really understanding it.<br /><br />If we lynch a guard claimant, and they are telling the truth, then we reduce the number of guards by 1, as well as giving the wolves an opportunity to kill another guard entirely. If we lynch a vanilla instead, then the wolves are either forced to keep a guard alive (at risk of killing a vanilla), or kill the person we want them to. If we lynch a guard claimant and are wrong, we could go from 3 guards to 1 in a single cycle. Not worth it.<br /><br />Case in point: if people had gone through with lynching death butt when he was being hella wolfy, humans would have lost the game then and there, despite there being a number of reasons to believe him to be such.<br /><br />Also saying that we only killed one wolf under the guidance of a wolf is actually not an argument for anything.
