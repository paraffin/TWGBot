			<dd class="postbody">
				a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...<br />life was born. Since then, a lot has changed. <br /><br />in fact it&#039;s been quite a long time since then. Not many people keep track of time these days, much less years. Not much reason to when any year is as good as the next. Not like you&#039;re going to die of old age, like some kind of barbarian. Time is pretty meaningless when you&#039;re immortal.&nbsp; <br />Historians estimate it&#039;s been like, a million years since the nuclear age. Whatever. Who cares. Historians are mostly squares. I hear there&#039;s a killer party going down round Narwhal&#039;s place. It&#039;s been going for something approximating two centuries, according to him. Dat life of leisure right? the band is supposed to be killer.&nbsp; <br /><br />And now you&#039;re at the party. This is the craziest party that could ever be.<br />Don&#039;t turn on the lights &#039;cause I don&#039;t wanna see. the radio is blastin&#039;, someone&#039;s knockin&#039; at the door<br />I&#039;m lookin&#039; at my girlfriend - she&#039;s passed out on the floor. <br /><br />Oshit wait. She&#039;s dead. Like for real guys shit we got some shit here. Momma told me not to come. <br />What do we even do?!? We don&#039;t have police. This society is fucking utopian. Last time someone died is when that <br />dumbass Dr. Wagon went spacediving without a backup plan. What was that, eighteen hundred cycles ago? I&#039;d almost forgotten his name. <br /><br />Anyway. There&#039;s really only one course of action open to us. We have to find out who is responsible for this. We have to bring these PARTY POOPERS to justice. And we all know there&#039;s also only one way to do that.<br /><br />Blood.&nbsp; <br /><br />the players. <br />1. lymric<br />2. yeagz<br />3. iron<br />4. eep<br />5. liftedpixel D3<br />6. adderallforall D2<br />7. deathbutt N1 <br />8. trientalis<br />9. swoopdoggydog D1 <br />10. xazarus<br />11. matt miller / guy<br /><br /><br />For the newbies&#039; sake I will try and be thorough about these here rules.<br /><br />1. I am the rules<br />2. Do not under any circumstances communicate with any player about the game outside of the game thread unless your PM explicitily states that you may do so. you may not &quot;quote&quot; PMs. <br />3. No death posts, no nights posts. <br />4. Vote by putting a name in bold. you may change your vote unlimited times until the day ends.<br />5. Majority rules the lynch at day&#039;s end. Ties will be broken in mysterious ways that only I understand (I promise there are rules about it, you just don&#039;t get to know.)<br />6. Inactive players suck and they aren&#039;t allowed.<br />7. Endgame occurs when either the PARTY POOPERS are all dead or the PARTY POOPERS outnumber the innocent. <br />8. Avatars are required. Don&#039;t change your username mid game (we&#039;re stuck with matt miller for the duration.)<br />9. Submit night actions no later than 24 hours after nightfall. <br />10. Any questions or confusion should be directed to me privately. <br />11. Do not edit your posts for any reason. <br /><br />Once again I want to say that this game is fairly experimental, and balance is not guaranteed at all. This is also my first time hosting. I apologize ahead of time if it ends up being a shitstorm.

				PMs are out. If you didn&#039;t get a PM, I&#039;ve probably fucked up the game horribly and it&#039;s all ruined. Let me know if that happened. <br />the game has begun.<br />you may post. <br /><br />If you&#039;re a newbie and you feel lost, read http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1129.0.html (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1129.0.html). <br />If you still feel lost, PM me.

				yeah ive played like 3 TWG games, so if you&#039;ve had cool D1s then ive never seen them. pretty much my whole experience with D1s so far has been fucking around and then dying within the first 3 D&#039;s.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t see how pointing out how D1 had been bullshit up until today (which it has) would make me suspicious whatsoever. I think observations if anything would make me an active player, because im saying something actually game relevant rather than just spouting flavor text about this shitty party, (where da burr at?).<br /><br />Also id say that no response on D1 can be disproportionate (unless in the vein of all caps and actually being a dumbass) since were all just doing nothing until something happens.<br /><br />Sure, someone has to be the D1 lynch, but if it could be me, why not you, eep, or Iron, or matt miller, or guy (yes I know..),&nbsp; or anyone for that matter. If you want to lynch me D1, do it, but like, don&#039;t lynch me (or anyone) and say that you&#039;ve&nbsp; got any evidence on anyone about anything because actually zero things have happened, so were all just throwing votes around pretty much.<br /><br />I guess what im trying to say is my vote for Iron and then eep held no merit, and I don&#039;t think any vote does until some actual evidence has been found

				this is a three-way tie, and, no, it&#039;s not good to try to kill as many people as possible. That is what wolves do. if anything, it would be better to lynch no one at all.<br /><br />plus, if there&#039;s even one wolf in this whole mess, chances are far more likely that a human will get sniped at the last minute. and, if there are any people with roles, you&#039;ll force them to claim early in the game, possibly compromising their effectiveness.<br /><br />if you want to know how ties are typically resolved, usually there&#039;s either a coinflip or a run-off vote between the candidates in the tie. it&#039;s not that interesting, and certainly not worth throwing away D1 for when there is plenty to go off of.

				okay. not lynching, or lynching fewer, prolongs the game and therefore information available to deduce things, leading to larger chances of lynchings being wolves<br /><br />the information that can be possibly available (from any source- night kill target, seer stuff, guardian stuff, other role stuff) increases very quickly as days progress<br /><br />obviously it is eventually detrimental to do this for a long time because you definitely kill zero wolves if not lynching, but it&#039;s far better than random lynching and especially random lynching two people at the beginning of the game<br /><br />those two people are (usually) more likely to be human than on any other day

That would mean it&#039;s all up to the psychological factors, such as human ability to discern wolves and wolvish ability to snipe humans. <br /><br />Also roles: More roles will probably die in Adderall&#039;s version. the math for hitting a role is about the same as the math for hitting a wolf, except NK&#039;s can kill roles.<br /><br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t force a tie more than once.

				Well, even a wolf has their reasons for making activity and generating information, usually to drive suspicions onto human players. But sure, perhaps all the activity is mainly human driven so far because wolves may lay low for the first day or so to gather information on how to best plan their attack. <br /><br />Adderall, is there a specific reason that you went with eep as the one to break the three way tie?

				Anywho, since no one has partied until 7 AM on a Saturday, it&#039;s time for eep&#039;s generalized theory on wolves! I&#039;ve gone back and looked through the thread and I recommend that other players do as well, lest they find they were misdirected. the truest form of sky is le ciel, n&#039;est pas? :winky:<br /><br />But enough dawdling. Let us commence.<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li><strong>Humans are apt to display a certain sort of confidence in their judgments, especially early in the game, that wolves tend not to.</strong></li></ul>This is not specifically my observation, but it is a rather well-put one that a very skillful player said in a game on a different board some time ago. There are exceptions to this, of course; some humans are just naturally more passive, humans with roles are more likely to try to hide under the radar, etc. But, in a general sense, wolves are the players who prefer to lay low until pressure is put on them.<br /><br />For this reason, Iron is actually pretty unlikely to be a wolf, and guy&#039;s comparative suspicion on me and Iron just for casting votes based on some loose, but not insignificant reasoning, is actually pretty strange.<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li><strong>Wolves need to keep track of a lot of lies in order to play well. This means that sometimes they slip up and contradict themselves.</strong></li></ul>Again, it&#039;s hard to tell <em>exactly</em> when this is happening, but it is something that is worth keeping an eye out for. Possible example that popped out for me when I went back through the thread include:<br /><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler: example 1" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1133.msg50883.html#msg50883">Quote from: guy on January 17, 2014, 04:08:06 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">similar to how i protected you last game or really anyone any game if i think the accusations are less than solid</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1133.msg50887.html#msg50887">Quote from: eep on January 17, 2014, 04:26:05 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s not comparable with your coming to my defense last game because lymric hasn&#039;t really done anything productive, which was your basis for defending me.

Because, in most cases, a wolf&#039;s win condition depends more on their staying alive than a human&#039;s depends on <em>their</em> staying alive, they will often have a heightened sensitivity to any attention put on them. Case in point is Lymric, who has never had the largest number of votes on him, but has claimed that he was being persecuted (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1133.75/msg,50900.html). And yet, when he posted that, he was part of a three-way tie between me, himself, and guy. He had guy coming to his defense, and while I was arguing against guy&#039;s purposeful obfuscation of my and iron&#039;s votes, I was not doing anything in particular to <em>persecute</em> lymric, nor has lymric ever been the most strongly targeted player in this game. <strong>He has always had the power to put the majority of the votes on a different player, though he chose not to do so with guy for quite some time.</strong> That he, and guy, would perceive two votes on lymric as worthy of immediate quenching, is in and of itself worthy of examination.<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li><strong>Wolves are more likely to cast wishy-washy or unhelpful votes.</strong></li></ul>Case in point, again, is Lymric. He has, thus far, only cast votes for people who have cast votes for him, and switched from that very quickly, as if being suspicious of him is something suspicious in and of itself (it&#039;s not). Furthermore, he states that he has no real reason for voting the people he&#039;s voted for, and essentially claims that I&#039;m a worthy lynch because, well, really anyone is at this point in the game:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1133.msg50888.html#msg50888">Quote from: Lymric on January 17, 2014, 04:32:31 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sure, someone has to be the D1 lynch, but if it could be me, why not you, eep, or Iron, or matt miller, or guy (yes I know..),&nbsp; or anyone for that matter.

But the fact that he is willing to die, as long as the person voting him doesn&#039;t claim they have evidence, suggests that he is not a role either.

				the claim of persecution had nothing to do with the amount of votes on me, and everything to do with the fact that you wont let my voting for you go.

But then you,<br />claiming that I back voted him for no apparent reason (totally did, no arguing that, but it was like hour 3 of D1 so who cares) send a vote my way, and back iron up. That, coupled with one of your initial post of having your eye on me, has reinforced (or even created, for that matter) my confidence in my vote for you, when again, it was just day 1 so I don&#039;t really have a SOLID reason, other than I had two votes on me, and Lifted had already voted for you, so why not tie it up.<br /><br />Ultimately what I want to say is that youre claiming how ive done so much to avoid suspicion with the small amount of pressure put on me, but you&#039;ve done the very same thing you&#039;ve accused me of, maybe even to a higher degree.

				I don&#039;t quite know what to make of this whole war between eep and lymric yet, but I think that one or both of them have a role, and also I don&#039;t see them as working together in any way. I&#039;m not sure one or the other seems wolfy yet. I kind of want to see how this all turns out, but eep seems rather distressed with the number of votes on her so my guess is that she is someone who is pretty important in this Narwhal party.

				I had something to say about eep but by the time I got to the end I had forgotten it<br /><br />I think it was something along these lines:<br />While I generally agree with eep about her &quot;what makes a wolf&quot; eval, I want to point out that there is also a pressure on repeat players from previous games. a wolf is attempting to act like a human. human eep is not a cuddly bunny D1. So it stands to reason that wolf eep won&#039;t be either.<br /><br />This is just an example. As eep says, what she is doing is still more helpful than inactivity even if she is a wolf.<br />Similarly, Lymric&#039;s war has contributed a lot of info. I wouldn&#039;t mind if he lived, but I do still think he&#039;s a good choice.<br /><br />My choices are limited by yeagz, xazarus, liftedpixel. Come on out of the woodwork - now&#039;s a great time, because there are huge arguments to respond to. Give your opinion.<br /><br />Matt Miller has opinions.

				let&#039;s make this big post about general game things and oh cool it magically all ties into who i was already suspicious of<br /><br /><br />like yeah if you read that post about general things in games people do early on as wolf or human, do you really think the fact that i happen to have not voted (there&#039;s no dire risk of anything at the moment and i don&#039;t feel particularly strongly in any direction) increases the likelihood that i&#039;m a wolf<br /><br />or even that it makes that scenario more reasonable?

				I mean more broadly I&#039;m disliking the fact that lymric is being given the space to respond poorly to suspicion entirely by guy&#039;s actions. It serves no purpose other than to obfuscate lymric&#039;s alignment, which strikes me as more of a wolf thing to do than a human one.<br /><br />My point in generally painting a picture of things to look out for in wolves was not to say &quot;hey look I&#039;m clearly innocent&quot; as it was to point out how little you guys are actually fucking looking for wolves. Yeah, you can sit here and turn everything I say against me, but in doing so, you are overlooking whether ANY other player might be a more likely wolf. in fact, I&#039;m skeptical that you&#039;re even looking for wolves; I am at least PROVIDING REASONS for my ongoing suspicions, whether you think they are adequately &quot;unbiased&quot; or not.<br /><br />I can think of at least three counts of how you guys will fuck yourself over if you don&#039;t start paying attention to players who are not me, and stop taking my cases against other people as defenses against myself, as if being confirmed human is even a desirable state in this game.<br /><br />Swoop, what you posted there was sure as hell not a reason for a bandwagon vote, and you aren&#039;t even attempting to claim that it was. So I would love to hear what you thought it was. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that it seemed like an attempt to shut me up, which I also don&#039;t think is a human-aligned goal in this game.<br /><br />One would think, after all these games, there would be at least one where I didn&#039;t get a vote on the basis of being aggressive day 1, that more than maybe one or two of you would maybe put two and two together and realize, nope, that actually doesn&#039;t mean anything.<br /><br />the flipside to my theory of wolf post, by the way, is that wolves who don&#039;t behave that way take on additional risks, and are more likely to be revealed one way or another, be it by their defense of teammates who get seered, or by screwing up outright, or something else.<br /><br />That being said, guy has a point about death butt, and iron noted earlier a potential nose-thumbing on butt&#039;s part regarding pixel.

				I dont know how this keeps getting so far off track, everything ive said in this thread is game related and not to be taken away but the game, if i was trying to attack your person the forum i would choose to do it in would not fucking be mysticboards. This is a game. I am commenting on your actions in the game, nothing i have said is to be taken as an attack on your out of game person. How something like this can even happen is fucking beyond me considering i had to ask guy who eep even is, I said emotionally charged because you were (as guy stated) being feisty/rather aggressive pretty quickly, thats all. i made that comment well before any large discussion even started happening.

				xaxarus-<br /><br />if someone is confirmed 100% human or close to, like for example if two masons* claim and then one is night killed, it means they are human and telling the truth. so anything that person says is pro-humans or from a mindset that wants humans to win. so they are bigger targets for the wolves than even special roles because they&#039;re not going to go away and wolves benefit from having people around they can throw suspicion on<br /><br /><br />*masons are paired roles that can communicate privately throughout the game. usually, both are human and know this of each other, though not always

				also, i changed my mind. i prefer vote order<br /><br />i think the problem i had originally with the way you were doing vote counts was that i was assuming you were going include all votes of the day in all counts, not just new ones and the totals, and i saw that getting messy and convoluted. also i keep mixing up who cast the vote and who ward<br /><br />the problem i have now is that it&#039;s not easy to look at what vote changes happened throughout the day<br /><br />my favorite (and what i use for hosting) is the easiest i&#039;ve seen and gives you the most information<br /><br /><br />organized by current vote totals on the far left, numbers in parenthesis beside voter names are the order the votes were cast. (do people dislike this?):<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">votes:</span><br /><strong>3 lymric</strong> (<del>4 iron</del>, 7 iron, 8 eep, 13 xazarus, <del>16 guy</del>)<br /><strong>3 eep</strong> (9 lymric, 6 pixel, <del>12 swoop</del>, 14 adderall)<br />2 swoop (15 deathbutt, 18 guy)<br />1 iron (1 trientalis, <del>5 lymric</del>)<br />1 guy (<del>2 swoop, 3 deathbutt</del>, 11 yeagz)<br />1 yeagz (17 swoop)<br />0 pixel (<del>10 adderall</del>)<br /><br />although your lists made it really easy to make this haha. the other thing i want to mention is that i think it&#039;s a good idea to try to post vote counts periodically, even if no votes have happened. maybe like every 20 posts or something. it helps to have updates in the middle of walls of text where it&#039;s easy to miss votes happening<br /><br />also, this way, it&#039;s easy to see how the votes fell and what was going on, at least in terms of votes, when each vote was cast

				IMHO the chronological information in that format is so poorly organized that it&#039;s essentially unreadable and it only serves to obfuscate the &quot;who&#039;s voting for who currently&quot; information and that&#039;s why I&#039;ve always hated it. <br /><br />Though a bit bulky my format IMO is very clearly laid out and leaves nothing out. If you want to look at one person&#039;s votes, just scan for their name in whichever column you&#039;re interested in.<br />I&#039;ve always kept my own vote counts and was assuming most people would maintain their own all-day list built from my fragmented ones.

				Well, we&#039;ll certainly get our tie. the swoop or lymric choices are sort of the same reasoning, i think, but at different portions of the Day. Eep is a whole different line of reasoning that might be a little suboptimal but still isn&#039;t the end of the world to me.

Not as if to say lynch her and not me, but im curious as to what gave you the impression shes more valuable than swoop or myself.<br /><br />I do feel like eeps playing style is pretty valuable in that aggression can&nbsp; over time uncover some stuff, so maybe that&#039;s what you&#039;re getting at: value thru playstyle? If so, id say that swoop and I aren&#039;t within the same reasoning, seeing as how I have a playing style general, be it valuable or not, rather than nothing.

				That&#039;s basically what I&#039;m getting at. you and swoop both did a lot of talking without backing it up. For you, lymric, it was early on, when people first started voting for you. My vote remains on you now more for what I&#039;ve read into your discussion (which, yes, is currently valuable).<br />Swoop kinda started doing the same thing later in the game. It&#039;s harder to get a read on him than you, but maybe he still deserves some votes for the same reason you did early on?

I do kind of understand why he would vote for someone who is not playing. That always is the worst, and inactives can really mess up a game. yeagz has not been around much at all, it would be nice to hear what he has to say about the game so far and adderall has popped in every now and then to say she is still watching, but I hope to hear from her sometime today on how she feels! eep&#039;s discussion is rather confusing, but possibly helpful because it brings up a lot of conversation. Lymric I think just got all tangled up in everything and just kind of started attracting bad attention unintentionally. I think there has been suspicion on eep a lot because she is talking a lot and drawing attention to herself. Anyone who started really protesting what eep was saying or started getting in a little quarrel with eep is also under pressure. So really it is hard to read what is going on with it all.

				I disfavor a tie because I doubt we will learn much about how ties are decided. the only benefit I can see it giving us is if someone snipes the lynch at the last second, which <em>can</em> be good information-wise, but that only really works if one of the people is a wolf and in the meantime you&#039;re forcing two potential humans to claim their roles. Since only one will be lyched, I assume, that puts the survivor at a big nk risk if they ended up claiming a role. <br /><br />So I think it&#039;s in the human interest to actively avoid a tie.

				To answer Xaz&#039;s question:<br /><br />2 or 3 wolves, basically always.<br /><br />Role amounts are different every game. a classic game has a guardian and a seer and maybe some masons (who can talk to each other).<br />Other than that you can&#039;t make a prediction.<br /><br />It is unfair of a host to choose roles any way other than RNG 99% of the time.

That, coupled with the fact that just coming out and claiming this is a relatively boring way to play the game, prompted me to see what I could do being more evasive-y or maybe even scumhunting a bit. I don&#039;t like needing to survive in a game. It&#039;s a pain, and I would rather do things where I could sacrifice myself in pursuit of some sort of knowledge.<br /><br />My guess is that this is the slight difference in aggression that you were noticing, guy. Whereas in most games I come at it with the attitude of, &quot;Yeah whatever kill me at least we&#039;ll get some info,&quot; in this case, my survival was more important than getting some info. Which was why it was frustrating when me doing my normal thing turned as much attention on me as it did.<br /><br />There&#039;s more to this, of course. Yeagz has a special &quot;revenge&quot; power that means if anyone takes me out, he&#039;ll go into a rage and kill &quot;the person responsible.&quot; I also have seer powers, and while I intend to use them to give myself collateral against the wolves, I don&#039;t intend to reveal my views unless someone does something to compromise our win condition.<br /><br />So, there you have it. It&#039;s a bad idea to lynch me no matter which team you are on. And it has absolutely nothing to do with death butt or xazarus, guy.

				Woah, eep claim. My last post was made without consideration of anything she said.<br /><br />Xazarus, this is what I meant about the game having experimental roles :p<br /><br />I doubt she&#039;s a wolf, since she named yeagie as her partner, and I believe the third-party status because why would she lie about that?<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that their lives count as human lives when it comes to the wolf vs human count, so it&#039;d be in our interests to vote a likely wolf instead of her or yeagie.

				I&#039;m not totally clear on how yeagz&#039;s role works regarding lynches. I count towards human numbers; I am technically an &quot;innocent party goer.&quot; What narwhal was actually handwave-y on was whether I can win alongside the wolves, since I don&#039;t know their specific win condition.<br /><br />Plus, seer abilities. There&#039;s a very real chance that humans don&#039;t have an actual seer and I&#039;m all you get. you should keep me alive on the chance that the wolves invoke my wrath and give you all a benefit.<br /><br />To db: most &quot;survivor&quot;-type roles have something like bulletproof. in contrast this is actually a pretty weak protective ability, since it won&#039;t actually help us unless the wolves know about it.<br /><br />And, no, you don&#039;t want to try holding yeagz hostage, because you won&#039;t even know when I have relevant info. But you are right, you can&#039;t necessarily trust me, and that possibility is exactly why it is worthwhile for the wolves to keep me alive, too.

				Eep, if you are not lying, I think the only balance I could use to justify your powers is that the wolves would both desire and fear to kill you.<br /><br />Otherwise I agree with Lymric. That&#039;s a lot of stuff to give a pair. <br /><br />Either way this is a warning that the wolves are probably superdeduper powered.<br /><br /><br />I would also like to point out that Narwhal&#039;s own TWG guide suggests that masonlike roles are not always coaligned - so it&#039;s possible that eep is a wolf and yeagz isn&#039;t, or vice versa.

				I dont know, seems a little strange but i doubt anyone who could be a fully &quot;human&quot; seer is going to come out during D1. From my perspective seers dont hold a whole lot of power in &quot;smaller&quot; games, whos to say this game will even go beyond D3(like the last) giving a seer 3 chances to find out about fellow party goers. Now in this case humans are presented with a &quot;seer&quot; who may be on their side, or might not be. I dont like that. Also changing the typical lovers role isnt out of line by any means but does strike me as strange. This could all be a conjured up mess just to throw things away from guys theory (i dont know why someone would be so elaborate with a story like this so early so i guess its a little far fetched) <br /><br />Plus we know that yeags now will go about in a possibly blind rage if eep gets Nk&#039;d or lynched. Which could easily cost either humans or wolves depending on who yeags deems responsible? I&#039;m debating taking my vote back to yeags to get rid of a potential time bomb.

				in fact, I&#039;m not even sure if narwhal ever has been in a game with more &quot;conventional&quot; lovers. We don&#039;t use that role very often here.<br /><br />Iron, I think you&#039;re approaching this from the assumption that we are human-aligned. If I could die and still win the game, these would be overpowered. However, since I cannot, I am still stuck in the land of &quot;oh shit oh shit how am I going to get through this thing.&quot; That we are powerful could work against us as much as it could work for us. Our primary goal is to not piss off either faction too much without just giving them power over us and for these purposes, our roles are only medium-powerful. Something like bullet-proof or guardian would be way, way more useful to us.<br /><br />I was explicitly told that yeagz was an innocent party-goer.<br /><br />Swoop - I don&#039;t intend to reveal any of my views unless yeagz is killed. I have no reason to. you are suggesting that I bank all my hopes on the human win condition when I actually might not want to do that. the primary benefit to humans and wolves isn&#039;t that I will give them views. It is that I will sit here and do nothing, thereby allowing them to focus on each other more easily without wondering about me in too much detail.<br /><br />Also, yeagz&#039;s ability is less vigilante and more the Bomb (http://wiki.epicmafia.com/index.php?title=Bomb). He isn&#039;t very powerful unless someone targets me, at which point he has already lost anyways, so<br /><br />Plus, for all we know, he could end up taking out a human vigilante.<br /><br />Whether I am telling the truth or not, though, my claim is out there. you can lynch us at any point in the game. It is a risk we face, and one that would be silly to take if we were not telling the truth. Day 1 is not the time to try getting rid of us. Focus your attentions elsewhere.

It means we probably don&#039;t want to keep both of you alive for the whole game, yet it&#039;s never really a great idea for us to lynch one of you, since then we pretty much know we&#039;re reducing the human count.<br /><br />So then maybe it&#039;d make the most sense to lynch yeagz today, even though I hate doing that to new players, since the chance of hitting a wolf on D1 is pretty slim anyway, compared to subsequent days. When we get a couple days in we won&#039;t be able to afford to just lynch a non-wolf unless we somehow know we&#039;ve killed a wolf.<br /><br />Lymric, and others who didn&#039;t play it, you might want to consider the last game we played, which I hosted. It was also an &#039;experimental, balance not guaranteed (in the end, balance fucked)&#039; game with nine people, no vanillas, and almost all entirely new role types. you can see the role reveal here: http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1114.345/msg,50569.html<br /><br />If even half of what eep has claimed is true, she and yeagz already have never-before-seen, to my knowledge at least, roles, so I wouldn&#039;t set my expectations based on what you&#039;ve seen or heard of before.<br /><br />So, strongly considering switching my vote to yeagz.

				So does a third party have to eventually end up as human or wolf? or can they just remain a third party till the end? My understanding of third party is that all they have to do is survive till the end to &quot;win&quot;. So to me they are not aligned in any way. <br /><br />It does sound like they got a ton of powers though. I&#039;m just super weary of any roles where you can talk to one another because of the way I got double crossed in the last TWG that I played (I was a human who could talk to a wolf using PM and was unaware that the person I was talking to was a wolf). <br /><br />But if they are both third party I am going to take them for their word now, and I think we should try to actually search out some wolves. I know someone already mentioned that it would be very weird for someone to outright state their wolf partner in a game. I think that is true, also eep has a huge bandwagon on her and it is not weird that she claimed her role. I feel like the way the conditions are going it is not in our best interests to kill them now. Perhaps later in the game if we don&#039;t feel like having a third party win the game? dunno, but we definitely should try to do what we can with the information we have as of now, which is a ton of information.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So looking at the people who had their votes on eep:<br />liftedpixel<br />lymric<br />adderall<br />swoop<br />guy<br /><br /><strong>Swoop</strong> seems to be threatened a lot by this claim. I am not exactly sure if it was coincidence or not but he voted for yegaz before eep even claimed and he has been bouncing his vote back and forth between the two the entire game.<br /><br />P.S. This post has taken me a while to write up and there were 27 new posts since I even got to say this, so I don&#039;t know if any of this is repeats. Sorry if so.<br />

				I am not with either team. But if wolves decide they want to make my game hard for me, I have no reason not to return the favor. If they decide to make the game easy for me, then I will let them alone.<br /><br />Truth be told, it&#039;s probably a bad idea for wolves to even be trying to challenge me, as they give more fodder for humans to assess.

				Its not that i am directly threatened by this claim, its that the roles these two have claimed can spell out serious trouble later in the game. if im going to put my D1 vote on someone i would like to know that it will atleast help later in the game.&nbsp; the possibility of Eep dying in this game and then yeagsuszuz loosing his mind and taking out someone on the human side is really something people need to consider, that action alone could end the game if the numbers are already in the wolves favor when/if eep dies( this is also assuming that yeagzuz is not taken out before eep, also eep may have abilities similar to yeagz since they are both lovers?)

				It would also be helpful to have more clarity on Yeagie&#039;s revenge kill, specifically, how the victim gets decided. If eep is targeted for an NK, will he kill the person who targeted her? If she is lynched, does he get to pick anyone, anyone who voted for her, or just the last person to vote for her?<br /><br />Yeagz, I think it&#039;s in your best interest to tell us everything you know, and ask Narwhal about anything you aren&#039;t sure on.

Surely not another crime, before we&#039;ve even had a chance to loose our growing frustration over the first one? Everyone is very relieved when, after two additional yelps, Narwhal bursts into the room. Literally, he kicked the door down. Deathbutt was caught in the blast radius and is jumping up and down holding his ankle and yelling about son-of-a-wrench-you-broke-my-foot. you&#039;re afforded a glimpse into the next room, where it appears that someone has broken the glass between the pool and the exotic aquarium. mystic is across the room talking loudly about how great his latest mix CD is while his hands are busy trying to untangle a large orange octopus from the stereo. you&#039;re all a bit fuzzy on the details, but no one is sure they&#039;ve actually seen Narwhal at his own party before this moment. He looks at you all, beaming. As he speaks, his voice isn&#039;t slurred, but he&#039;s noticeably swaying from side to side as he stands in one place. <br /><br />&quot;Hey you guys I just wanted to say I&#039;m really glad you&#039;re here and I&#039;m really glad I get to celebrate my,&quot;<br />He&#039;s interrupted as someone rudely drives a small three wheeled electric vehicle through the room.<br />&quot;Thanks for celebrating my one thousandth post with me you guys it really means a lot to me I couldn&#039;t have done it without you I really love you guys do you guys knows that especially you guy you&#039;re my best friend in the whole damn world guy.&quot;<br /><br />Liftedpixel sloppily tries to congratulate him on the party but he is distracted by discovering his cup is mysteriously empty. Still grinning, he sidles up to Iron and switches cups with him, and then dumps it on eep&#039;s head.&nbsp; She squeaks adorably, and then stutteringly tries to tell him about the lady who&#039;s been killed and all the drama that has followed. Tossing the cup with a laugh, he is then escorted out of the room, apparently totally unhearing, by three attractive women with really godawful annoyingly high pitched laughs. No one is quite sure from the expression on Narwhal&#039;s face how he feels about this.

				One good thing about keeping yeagz alive is that it at least lets us have some idea of what motivations eep might have. If yeagz is dead then who knows what she&#039;ll do. With yeagz alive we can at least speculate on whether she is feeling pro-human or wolf at the moment.

				basically, it&#039;s problematic because since everyone knows all about it, she has to tip toe around everyone the whole game<br /><br />and it&#039;s way easier to tip toe around humans than wolves. think about it- we&#039;re gonna have to spend a lot of time and effort talking about whether or not to believe everything she says. but on the other hand, the wolves will know immediately who she is trying to help<br /><br />also, the fact that they count as human seems good and why not leave her/them around, but we have to lynch them sometime otherwise we will always risk ending the game early because they can easily vote with the wolves<br /><br /><br />what i&#039;m afraid of is that towards the end of the game it will be easier and faster for them to win through the wolves and we&#039;re not even gonna know it&#039;s happening<br /><br />swoop is at the very least helpful now and seems damn human to me

				I gotta say, killing yeagz seems like an inherently wolfy action to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s really two main reasons to kill yeagz.<br />1. Freeing yourself/others up to kill eep.&nbsp; And believing eep&#039;s yeagz-bomb story seems like it would be significantly correlated with believing that she&#039;s a seer.&nbsp; So it seems like you&#039;re fairly openly trying to free things up to kill the human seer.<br /><br />2. Getting eep pissed off at the humans by lynching rather than NK-ing yeagz.&nbsp; Then you might be able to get her help, and if you can&#039;t, you can always kill her.<br /><br />3. Killing a third party just in case, in the future, they turn against you.&nbsp; Since they (most likely) count as humans, probably more likely to be a wolf move.&nbsp; If humans don&#039;t fuck with yeagz, there&#039;s no reason for the two of them to work with the wolves.&nbsp; the maximum benefit for them is probably to be completely neutral, and hint at both sides that they might work with them, so neither side will kill yeagz off.&nbsp; This is a good thing, they&#039;ll just sit around flirting with both sides, not doing shit, contributing to the human count.&nbsp; If anybody besides us fucks with yeagz, then we&#039;ll probably get eep&#039;s support.<br /><br />4. Not voting for swoop.&nbsp; Not sure exactly how much I trust guy really, but this is a legitimate reason.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if this is the wolfiness eep&#039;s been hinting at.<br /><br />Oh god 28 replies since I started typing.&nbsp; Doing it anyway.

She&#039;s pointing a finger at swoop. If<strong> yeagz </strong>dies she&#039;ll probably view swoop and then we&#039;ll know.

Freeing yourself/others up to kill eep.&nbsp; And believing eep&#039;s yeagz-bomb story seems like it would be significantly correlated with believing that she&#039;s a seer.&nbsp; So it seems like you&#039;re fairly openly trying to free things up to kill the human seer.<br /><br />2. Getting eep pissed off at the humans by lynching rather than NK-ing yeagz.&nbsp; Then you might be able to get her help, and if you can&#039;t, you can always kill her.<br /><br />3. Killing a third party just in case, in the future, they turn against you.&nbsp; Since they (most likely) count as humans, probably more likely to be a wolf move.&nbsp; If humans don&#039;t fuck with yeagz, there&#039;s no reason for the two of them to work with the wolves.&nbsp; the maximum benefit for them is probably to be completely neutral, and hint at both sides that they might work with them, so neither side will kill yeagz off.&nbsp; This is a good thing, they&#039;ll just sit around flirting with both sides, not doing shit, contributing to the human count.&nbsp; If anybody besides us fucks with yeagz, then we&#039;ll probably get eep&#039;s support.<br /><br />4. Not voting for swoop.&nbsp; Not sure exactly how much I trust guy really, but this is a legitimate reason.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if this is the wolfiness eep&#039;s been hinting at.<br /><br />Oh god 28 replies since I started typing.&nbsp; Doing it anyway.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I disagree with this. the third party is a threat to us. Furthermore, eep is invulnerable until yeagz is gone, so if she is truthful about her powers but false about her alignment, it&#039;s a necessary step (I think she is truthful about her alignment). Eep-yeagz neutrality cannot last long and still be a game. I predict that they will spiral into apathy like guy did when he was in eep&#039;s shoes. I would have sided with eep if she hadn&#039;t claimed, tbh. If they offer an alliance with the humans that is different, and that&#039;s what I&#039;m going to advocate.

Again, the benefit to keeping us around has never been my seer powers, but a bit of extra wiggle room you get, and an opportunity to look at other players.

				the point, of course, isn&#039;t that anyone can trust what I say. the point is that I <em>scare</em> the wolves, which is evident enough in the fact that there are so many people diverting attention from <em>anything</em> else in an effort to kill of yeagz. Wolves are in a precarious situation as is, and they don&#039;t like unpredictable factors that might work to their disadvantage. I have been that unpredictable factor today, in coming out as a confirmed role, where they were previously in a good position to lynch me.<br /><br />Do wolves tend to control the day 1 lynch?

				Iron, you have a very real tendency in these games to side with your relatives/people close to you over others in the game, and it does not always work to your advantage. There have been instances when you have let both Modi and Narwhal slide under the radar because you went by your opinion of them outside the game, rather than judging what was going on. you would do well to be mindful of this. I suspect I will have cause to bring this up again later.

				No, he does it a slightly different way when he is a wolf versus human. Trust me, I know the difference, and I have picked up on it in other games. Sometimes it is unclear to me, but other times it is just some little thing I can&#039;t specifically describe that makes things so fucking clear to me.

Guy and eep&#039;s battle of wits has dissolved into fisticuffs. They&#039;ve knocked over the chocolate fountain and the ice sculpture of Princess Jasmine. Adderall is huddled in the corner mumbling about work in the morning. Xazarus is in tears over deathbutt&#039;s ankle. Swoop and Yeagz sit in chairs facing each other, eyes wide, unblinking. Iron watches intently. Finally, yeagz loses the staring contest. <br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s not fair, Lymric splashed vodka in my eye!&quot; He protests. Lymric throws and orange at his head. the arguing continues. <br /><br />Everyone is thirsty for revenge but everyone, especially guy, is too much of a giant sissy pants to do anything about it. <br /><br />&quot;Why don&#039;t we just kill them both?&quot; Adderallforall suggests; guy nearly faints at the suggestion. Finally, when they&#039;ve resolved the only thing to do is to have the two fight to the death using party favors, Narwhal reappears. the huge, gleaming tusk that has been surgically implanted in his shoulder sometime between now and his one thousandth post dominates the room and the attention of everyone in it. It shines like backlit silver. Eep once again starts to explain, but he silences her with a wave. <br /><br />&quot;I understanding we&#039;re having some disgreement as to which of these fine gentlemen is the beer pong champion of the week??&quot; He croons. Eep is about to say no, the situation is much more serious than that, but he pokes her in the belly button. <br /><br />&quot;Now give me a piece of paper here and I&#039;ll see if I can work this out.&quot; <br /><br />a sleek, spotless white android appears out of nowhere, notepad and spacepen in hand. <br />For several minutes Narwhal fusses with the paper, scratching out this, drawing large circles around that. He won&#039;t let anyone look over his shoulder. He asks yeagz for the derivitave of 2sinx^(2x), who knows it off the top of his head. the android brings him three more drinks; two gin and tonics and a shot of fireball. He scribbles out a few things. Finally, with a triumphant grunt, he stands up. He turns the paper around. <br /><br />All he has written on the paper is &quot;6 x 9 = 42&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Party foul dude. you gotta leave.&quot; He makes his hand into a gun shape and points at <strong>Swoop.</strong> <br />&quot;Bang.&quot;<br />Swoop hangs his head, turns around, and lets the doors close behind him forever. <br /><br />Yeagz and eep sit in the middle of the room, holding each other, crying. the rest of you disperse, wandering into other rooms and other parts of the party. the bar in this room has run dry. you needed to clear your head, anyway. <br /><br />Get those night action PMs in ASAP, preferably before 24 hours have passed.<br /><br />Congrats guys, you just participated in the longest D1 ever. Also we did this which is sort of neat. <br /><br />(http://gyazo.com/5eee63d1a6887f7fd9e3f9e3c7fa41fe.png)

				uh what do you mean why do i have so much against you<br /><br />the fact that both you and death butt were doing the same thing day1 was weird, but not worth lynching over. it was worth getting information out of eep. i was not suspicious of you until you backed eep at the end of day1 for reasons that i didn&#039;t think were genuine<br /><br />death butt wasn&#039;t part of any theory. i was just suspicious of him so i had him in my &quot;possibly wolf&quot; headbrain.<br /><br />so what were the contents of the other half of your pm? if i&#039;m being completely honest, he&#039;s telling the truth. i do hate him. i&#039;m kind of 3rd party too, and i kind of suspect everyone is. i also played around with the idea of there being no wolves. i&#039;m a perfectly normal party goer but i can&#039;t win if xazarus is alive<br /><br />i had actually assumed this meant that he had the exact same role opposite me. and so i assumed this meant he wasn&#039;t a wolf. because a wolf wouldn&#039;t have a role of &quot;you can&#039;t win if this person is still alive&quot; because they can just kill them. i wasn&#039;t going to say anything about it and just thought the wolves would kill him or i could convince people later, but when he jumped on me with reasons i thought were silly, and then day2 attacked iron, i just went with it because i figured i could convince people<br /><br />but like<br /><br />doesn&#039;t that suggest <strong>xazarus</strong> is a wolf? and i&#039;m not? i didn&#039;t even honestly think he was a wolf until just now

				i mean do you need for wolves AND xazarus to die in order to win? or just xazarus?<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to do it because that would be playing favorites to win and that&#039;s a dumb way to win the game. That being said, the only way that this could possibly hope to give humans a fighting chance is if one of you is a wolf.

				Also it is hilarious that narwhal gave you that role. But I think I disapprove of him giving so many new players win conditions that are basically just death sentences.<br /><br />However, this gives me an idea for a <em>wicked</em> fun game possibility.<br /><br />in any case, it is in my interest to get one wolf lynched if there are three; doing so would substantially reduce the danger to me and yeagz, per WIFOM.

However, much like in football, where you can use the victory formation to run off the clock without running a legitimate play, at a point where wolf numbers equal human, it is assumed that they will lynch and NK the remaining humans that are completely powerless to stop it, assuming ties go in wolf favor, simply to spare everyone wasting time. <br /><br />This is not the case in this game. the game will simply be over at that point, without assuming any moves on the wolve&#039;s part. I chose my wording in describing &quot;endgame&quot; conditions carefully in an attempt to make that distinction. <br /><br />I do not publicly confirm that the wolf win condition is to have the same number of living players as the human team. Nor do I publicly confirm that humans alive at that point could be eligible to win, though clearly I have taken care to leave that possibility open. <br /><br />Privately, everyone&#039;s PM stated their win conditions, hopefully in a clear manner, so refer to that if you have further confusion. Once again I chose the wording for win conditions carefully, so keep in mind that every requirement for win conditions has been stated in your PM. in other words, IF your PM does NOT say &quot;All wolves must be dead at endgame for you to win&quot; then that is not the case; I didn&#039;t just forget to mention it.

				I&#039;ve wibble wobbled on eep&#039;s case a lot. I supported her pre-claim D1. Then after her claim it looked like a bad idea to keep that invulnerable duo around (which would mean lynching yeagz, not eep). There&#039;s no reason to ever lynch eep, basically, unless she turns on humans completely (which she could only do by voting with a known wolf or something). Again, I think that role is a stinker.<br /><br /><br />the best reason to keep yeagz around is with an alliance with eep (and yeagz). If you go back to D1, I spent most of the day hoping for something like that. I think it&#039;s the right way to play Narwhal&#039;s game. It wasn&#039;t gonna happen that day. Now perhaps Xaz is thinking along similar lines. If eep turns her fantastic powers to the greater good then all is cool, since I believe her claim (mostly).<br /><br />Does that answer your question? I will go find a quote if you forget when I asked (repeatedly) for an alliance.<br /><br />(why does this post have so many parens)

				the claim is that only yeagz has the bomb power. Kill eep, and yeagz kills the responsible party automatically.

				It says right there in the quote. Guy preferred interesting above winning. I think what adderall says made perfect sense and I don&#039;t care if you accuse me of nespotism.<br /><br />Also I&#039;m glad eep is here to be suspicious of literally everyone.

				I believe Iron and Adderall are the wolves. This would make sense as to why eep thinks that he is giving unfair advantage to his one relative in this game, also adderall is about the only one that I have seen iron consistently agree with and back up whatever she says, or try to make something that someone may take as a slip up of a wolf as a new human mistake.<br /><br />Also he is fairly convinced that everyone in this game has partners. That would lead me to believe that he is in a partnership with someone, but he is not going to share it. I will let everyone know that I am not in a partnership. <br /><br />Then there is the fact that guy wants to kill xaz. That seems a bit off to me. I don&#039;t know if that would be a wolf condition or human condition to win. Liftedpixel has been acting very along the lines of what the human role seems like to me. eep and yeagz have been claimed as the human partnership. So that is all the players we have alive yet. <br /><br />I am not sure if Swoop was a wolf or not. There was a lot of fighting over tie votes, and guy made the tie vote happen. Perhaps guy seems a little wolfy but it really doesn&#039;t make sense to me that a wolf or human would be assigned to kill one specific person. So for now, I will be keeping my vote on Iron.<br /><br />I&#039;d go back and try to analyze the nightkill, but that would just be so much reading right now. Guess I will do that later.

This would be poor game design if true IMO, but I can&#039;t rule it out.</div></div><br />Eep was the first to claim, although she wouldn&#039;t know her partner was a wolf if this was all true. That makes her less likely in my book to be lying.<br /><br />This is part of the wolfhunt. a large portion of the players are going to be in pairs, so it&#039;s not like claims are immune to scumhunts.<br /><br />I don&#039;t find what adderall says even a little bit suspicious. What she doesn&#039;t say is more important. <br />-Adderall and Pixel are unclaimed<br />-Trientalis and Lymric and I are partial claims<br />-Eep-yeagz, guy-xaz are fully claimed.<br /><br />If you&#039;re fully convinced that your partner is not a wolf, it makes sense to vote for adderall, but I don&#039;t have that luxury.

				regarding adderall, i&#039;m not set on how i feel about things yet, but i definitely feel trientalis seems more wolfy than her<br /><br />but i could be swayed. i&#039;ll go back and look at shit if i have a chance<br /><br />it&#039;s mostly that adderall has seemed to remain impartial and helpful during arguments. while this could be a wolf trait, the thing that really got me was how she jumped on iron toDay (genius by the way) when presented the opportunity by xazarus

				1. lymric - claimed third party with human-tolerant win condition; can prove his humanity<br />2. yeagz - claimed to be the Bomb to eep&#039;s role<br />3. iron - claimed third party with humanlike win condition<br />4. eep - claimed Seer and partner with yeagz<br />5. liftedpixel - not much, isn&#039;t caught up yet<br />6. adderallforall - caught up but unclaimed<br />8. trientalis - implied third party<br />10. xazarus - claimed allied with guy<br />11. guy - claimed allied with xaz<br /><br />the problem with this weird setup is that it&#039;s not really possible to say who is expendable, a safe-ish lynch. Eep is the only exception as a power, and Lymric claims he can be confirmed. Yeagz could also argue that he&#039;s an exception, &#039;cause he could vig a wolf eventually, especially on a tied final Night (something I only just noticed by re-reading Narwhal&#039;s posts). <br /><br />the situation is analogous to a normal game where guy, xaz, trient, pixel, adderall, and myself, iron, had never claimed a role. I see zero problems lynching any of these folks from non Ironic perspectives. Atm I am leaning xaz or pixel: pixel has shown nothing much yet today and xaz made a lot of snap judgments that one might consider a scummy sign.<br /><br />Lymric can you confirm that you have a useful power other than proving yourself? Or is that the extent of it?<br /><br />We have about 48 hours and some change before Day ends.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll put a vote on <strong>xaz</strong>.

				it really feels like eep viewed iron as wolf and that&#039;s why she and yeagz are going after adderallforall<br /><br />the possibility of this being the case is silly and exactly what i was talking about. it&#039;s hard enough to combat 2 wolf votes, let alone twice that. 2 might not seem like a lot, but it means it requires 3 humans to agree and simultaneously disagree with the wolves to overcome them, and humans are not known for that kind of adamancy (because they don&#039;t know anything for sure)<br /><br />anyway, this is exacerbated by eep and yeagz, who increase that to 5 humans<br /><br />and also eep and yeagz can vote freely and openly against the good of the humans and we won&#039;t do anything about it because they aren&#039;t wolves. isn&#039;t that fun<br /><br />the wolves can stay in the shadows as long as eep and yeagz do their bidding. and they can throw a seemingly meaningless whatever vote on the eep/yeagz bandwagon and it looks completely legit

				Looks like you all finally grew some balls, because tonight&#039;s decision is swift and decisive. Like a fox hunting mice in the snow, the party&#039;s will comes crashing down on <strong> Adderall4all</strong>. Actually, that&#039;s literal. Adderall4all is held down on the floor by burly men in nurses uniforms while the party goers gleefully force pills collected from various sources down her throat. I&#039;m pretty sure some brown acid went down. After a while she stops convulsing, and she just starts drooling, her eyes rolled back into her head. That&#039;s what you get for being a <br />_____________<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />---------------------<br /><br />the aforementioned men drag her out of the room by her ankles.<br />FINALLY, we can get back to having a good time. Someone passes out those things that you blow on and they uncurl and make a ruckus, and you all shout the countdown. the chant comes to a feverish high as you hit &quot;-e!&quot; the ball drops and everyone starts making out for no apparent reason. <br /><br />N2 begins now. <br /><br /><br />

				you all wake up to find AngryNarwhal towering over you. Collectively. He&#039;s somehow managing to be really tall at the moment. It&#039;s probably home field advantage.<br /><br />&quot;I heard some crazy nasty shit has been going down with you guys and I&#039;m not happy about it. you all are invited to this party CONDITIONALLY, and if you&#039;re not cool you&#039;re out! Now Deathbutt is going to be the LAST CASUALTY, you got that?&quot;<br /><br />the crows mumbles uncomfortably. Lymric scratches his nose awkwardly. Realizing how poorly you have handled the situation, everyone feels pretty bad about what happened to adderall, but no one wants to get kicked out of the party, either. There is a lot more fondue to eat and a lot more belly button shots to be shooted. Plus this band is totally radical. <br /><br />Finally, an anonymous voice speaks up. <br />&quot;So uhhhhhh....about last night....&quot;<br />When Narwhal finds out, he&#039;s pretty pissed. He&#039;s so pissed he drops his drink. He&#039;s so pissed a girl in the other room shreiks. He makes an announcement on the PA and pretty soon, those two guys who dragged her off dragged her back in, though now they&#039;re dressed as two of the Marx brothers. Weirdly though you can&#039;t quite pin down which two.<br /><br />Anyway Narwhal bends down and listens to her breath.<br />&quot;Seriously you guys this was my favorite friggen sister. the fuck is wrong with you guys. you&#039;re lucky though, she&#039;s only mostly dead.&quot;<br />He slips a large chocolate coated pill into her mouth. <br />&quot;She&#039;ll wake up soon. She&#039;ll be pretty weak, so you fuckers give her her space, you hear?&quot;<br /><br />As he says this he presses a button on his incredibly futuristic supersmart armband with holographic display and a prism of light springs up around Adderall4all&#039;s unconscious body. It looks like a forcefield straight outta Star Trek.<br /><br />&quot;No more bullshit. I&#039;m going to go get some shrimp cocktails.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />D3 begins. None deceased overnight. Adderall4all is pseudoalive.

Even if you are a third party human, you still should somewhat be in favor of the humans. Shouldn&#039;t you?? If the wolves kill off most of the humans before the humans kill the wolves then you are loosing the battle, no matter what. Each day that a wolf survives puts that third party human more at risk of being killed in the night or even being lynched during the day by a crafty wolf who gets a bandwagon started on that third party human.

				I&#039;m just checking in, I guess.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel any terribly strong inclination to vote for Iron, because I want new information first.&nbsp; We&#039;re all still voting for him based on yesterday.&nbsp; It&#039;s a new day, we have to have learned something.&nbsp; But it seems like pretty much all we (collectively) learned is exactly how little we (collectively) know about what the hell is going on in general.<br /><br />It seems somewhat likely that eep viewed Iron, found him to be a wolf, and helped bandwagon him.&nbsp; But she won&#039;t say anything about it unless she has to, and since she&#039;s voting for iron anyway, she might well say it even if it isn&#039;t true.&nbsp; If anybody else learned/did anything useful, they&#039;re keeping it to themselves for their 3P win conditions.<br /><br />So I&#039;m around, I just don&#039;t think I have much to contribute.

				I think a good vote would be on <strong>Trientalis.</strong> in fact I had thought her in a similar position to adderall. I&#039;d like to either hear more about Tri&#039;s situation or at least a good reason why we shouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />My goal for this boring day is to decide who can work alongside of my traditional-like win condition. I&#039;m guessing most third parties will at least want wolves dead eventually, but I also guess that many will have distractions along the way. Those are perhaps the ones who are a) more expendable b) more likely to attempt to use the wolves to get what they want and c) more likely to be wolves anyway, since they can justify certain actions by citing &quot;Third party! Third party!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Also I just now noticed the Ender&#039;s Game-style pun in the themeflavor of this game.

				eep, why are you being so evasive with letting us know who you viewed if you are a seer? If you are indeed human-sided then try to help though it may not be in your best interest for you third party stuff perhaps? It already seems like your claim of having yeagz kill the person who kills you is kind of keeping you both safe at the moment because we never know if you just reversed your roles, and you may actually be the one that blows up if someone kills yeagz. So what is wrong with helping us scum hunt? <br /><br />Perhaps you are just two really really crafty wolves?<br /><br /><br />Also, I&#039;d like to point out that when we tried to lynch Adderall, it was stated that brown acid may have went down. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1133.msg51773.html#msg51773">Quote from: AngryNarwhal on January 27, 2014, 11:40:39 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Adderall4all is held down on the floor by burly men in nurses uniforms while the party goers gleefully force pills collected from various sources down her throat.

				Let me tell you a little bit more about myself.<br /><br />For starters, I have a partner, though I&#039;m not going to claim that partner&#039;s identity. I am not explicitly sure they are an innocent, though they could be.<br /><br /><br />More importantly, my win condition means I&#039;m among the last people you want to be lynching. I win if and only if the wolves are all dead, regardless of my partner&#039;s survival, like a typical hooman. Unlike guy, I have no incentive to terminate my partner, but maybe we&#039;re in a similar boat anyway.<br /><br />Everyone benefits from scumhunting, but I am the one person we&#039;ve heard of so far that will never have any distractions from scumhunting, never have incentive to work in the wolves pocket, or go harrumphing off after a rival partner.<br /><br />I have a minor power which interacts positively with someone else&#039;s power, someone described as a hero. I wasn&#039;t told who had the power I interact with, or who the guests are. I&#039;m not sure my power is enough to contribute to my value as a living player, but it&#039;s something.

				<strong>Iron</strong>, you seem like a wolf to me the most because <br /><br />a. you have a partner who you can speak to, but will not disclose this person. Seems much more wolf-like than say, eep and yeagz who we know are associated with one another but are not scared to say what they are. <br /><br />b. because wolves usually have a partner that they can talk to outside of the thread, and they don&#039;t want others to know they are associated so that they can cause chaos. <br /><br />c. If guy and xazarus are paired in a way, eep and yeagz are paired, adderall, lifted and me are not paired, then that leaves you paired with either lymric or a guy who is already dead. So it is likely you have perhaps even reached your win condition somewhat? I dunno, maybe you just have to survive to the end of the game to win now. <br /><br />Also, why are you pushing me to tell you my win condition so badly? It is nothing out of the ordinary. Just live, and because I am human, try to find the wolves. <br /><br /><br />

				Sorry. I don&#039;t know why the hell everyone decided to wait until last minute to say a damn thing. But I think it&#039;s very important when running a game to stick to announced deadlines. There were some issues with that last game that left me, at least, rather frustrated. I&#039;m making the exception now because I screwed myself on this one. <br /><br />1. guy - iron 733<br />2. eep - iron 734<br />3. yeagz - iron 735<br />4. lymric - iron 742<br />5. iron - trient 761<br />6. lymric - unvote 790<br />7. trient - iron 802<br />8. trient - unvote 821<br />9. eep - lifted 829<br />10. xazarus - trient 835 <br />11. trient - lifted 836<br /><br />Totals <br />lifted pixel 2 - eep, trientalis<br />iron 2 - yeagz, guy<br />trientalis 2 - iron, xazarus<br /><br />I love you guys, lol. you have until the end of the hour to resolve this tie before I do it for you.

				i am as positive as i can be given the information narwhal has given me. there is always the possibility that i am being given crazy views, but there are other elements that make it, at least in my book, more likely that these two are the wolves.

				Trientalis - why do you think we are the actual wolves?<br /><br />I&#039;ll add one more layer to this: yeagz is actually a roleblocker, not a bomb. N2, I viewed pixel and he blocked Iron. We put two and two together and made an educated guess that pixel and iron were the wolves, which was why, at first, I wanted to lynch Iron rather than pixel. That way, we could block a confirmed wolf while getting rid of one of their most likely partners, but it all worked out in the end, I guess.<br /><br />you will recall, also, that Lymric confirmed the existence of a roleblocker D2. Given that blocks have happened since then (and a roleblocker is more likely than a guardian, since it happened two days in a row), it&#039;s reasonable to believe that the roleblocker is still alive, and if we are lying, you will get a counterclaim.<br /><br />If you want what I believe to be very fair and balanced advice regarding how to proceed: lynch Iron, and if the game isn&#039;t over, then lynch me or yeagz.<br /><br />Also, iron, what makes you believe I lied about my guy view?

				a vote for Iron is an insult to Narwhal&#039;s ability as GM. <br /><br /><br />Those rules do matter, because they have good reasons for existing. <br /><br />So in a 10-12 person game there are 2 or 3 wolves. a roleblocker won&#039;t block himself. That leaves him 9-11 choices and 2-3 chances to hit a wolf the first night, which increases as the game progresses. He only needs to stop one wolf to succeed.<br /><br />That&#039;s between an 18% chance and a 33% chance EACH NIGHT which INCREASES as the game progresses.

				seriously look at what yeagz is claiming<br /><br />roleblocker that can block wolf kills<br /><br /><br />which means, not including yeagz or eep because he knows they&#039;re not wolf, he starts the game with 9 choices <br /><br /><br />but that&#039;s not night one when he first uses it. night 1 swoop was dead, so he has 8 choices<br /><br />assuming there is more than one wolf, 2/8 is 25% chance to hit wolf night 1. <br /><br /><br />if it doesn&#039;t, night 2 he subtracts the person he blocked last time, the person that was night killed night1, and the person who was lynched day2 (assuming they&#039;re all different people), and there are only 5 more choices. if none of the wolves had died yet, which isn&#039;t unlikely with only two lynches, 2/5 is 40%, and it&#039;s probably a pretty sure thing by then if you just logic out a little bit from the thread<br /><br /><br />

				Wait so are we voting for them because theyre wolves or because theyre making a mockery of Narwhals ability as a GM because the latter is so dumb.<br /><br />He said at the beginning of this thing that it could be super unbalanced, and im almost entirely convinced that eep is human based on things shes said.\<br /><br />Seriously, since when does the GM have anything to do with how we vote. That&#039;s a dumb way to think about playing this game, because hes not supposed to be there actively, more of an omniscient kinda dude, and we shouldn&#039;t just throw votes around based on &quot;Narwhals a good GM fuck you guys.&quot; <br /><br />Im all for voting for Yeagz/eep (more yeagz than eep) but like you&#039;ve gotta give me something more than that.

				did you guys completely ignore the first post i made?<br /><br /><br />we have two choices here. either iron is telling the truth or eep/yeagz are<br /><br />eep/yeagz could easily still be wolves, and if they are, it&#039;s way more dangerous to be wrong about them than it is to be wrong about iron<br /><br />the safest route for human victory is to go for eep/yeagz for now because there are more of them and we don&#039;t lose as much if we&#039;re wrong<br /><br />if eep/yeagz are the wolves, and we lynch iron, we&#039;d be down to 6 players tonight and then 5 tomorrow and mostly in the same spot, but then we&#039;d have to be right<br /><br />if iron is the wolf, and we lynch eep/yeagz, it&#039;d still be 5 people tomorrow, but it&#039;s more likely than there would only be one wolf (iron) than two<br /><br />so basically, by voting eep/yeagz, we increase the likelihood of there being only 1 wolf left day 5 and decrease the likelihood of there being 2. this is the same thing we would do in any game when there was a clear divide between two groups of people where we pretty much know if one side is not wolf the other is<br /><br />i&#039;m kind of getting annoyed that every time you guys disagree with me i must be making up silly logic because of my role

				also no successful guard is not that unlikely<br /><br />regardless of whether or not you&#039;re(eep/yeagz) wolves, the guardian would not guard you because of your claimed bomb ability. first, because the wolves aren&#039;t gonna target you and second because if wolves kill one of you you&#039;ll be spiteful against them and that helps humans and therefore guardian. so it&#039;s better if you&#039;re unguarded. and they don&#039;t need to guard anyone people have been suspicious of recently (iron, trientalis)<br /><br />so there aren&#039;t really that many choices left for guardian either. and there&#039;s no reason i wouldn&#039;t be a likely target for wolves, even multiple nights in a row

				because the idea of stopping night kills indefinitely is ridiculous, so i lean towards believing iron<br /><br /><br />but even if i didn&#039;t, and even if i pretend they&#039;re equally believable, killing eep or yeagz first is safer. why not kill iron? because if we&#039;re wrong and eep/yeagz are the wolves, there are more wolves alive<br /><br />if eep/yeagz are telling the truth, it&#039;s likely there is only one wolf left, MAYBE 2. if iron is telling the truth, there are at least two wolves alive, maybe more. the safer choice is obviously take out eep or yeagz first

				also, it&#039;s possibly worth noting the possibility that lymric is a wolf<br /><br /><br />his ability has only happened when there have been no deaths. it&#039;s possible he&#039;s not lying entirely about his ability but it could be slightly different to be a wolf ability. so maybe he can choose between normal kill and using the ability<br /><br /><br />this would suggest yeagz is not the reason the night kills haven&#039;t been happening, but doesn&#039;t inherently suggest yeagz is lying<br /><br /><br />actually, this scenario makes a lot of sense. it would mean yeagz can&#039;t really block night kills, which makes a hell of a lot more sense, but he can still block other things (possibly blocked lymric&#039;s night 1, so there was a regular kill, idk)<br /><br />my thinking is maybe lymric&#039;s role is he needs to find a specific person but he&#039;s also a wolf. so he can take someone, making them pseudoalive, but if he takes another they&#039;ll die. it&#039;s essentially a delayed kill <br /><br /><br />iron/lymric seems likely

				the other thing, guy, is that there might be at least 2 wolves remaining, and that&#039;s not counting scenarios like dueling packs which also seem possible given this game. so the claim that there are more wolves if me/yeagz are lying doesn&#039;t really hold up.<br /><br />hell, xazarus might still be a wolf for all we know. it&#039;s one of the only ways a game could be even remotely balanced if there are 3 wolves with all these different win conditions going around.<br /><br />beyond that, though, a guardian claim doesn&#039;t specifically counter the roleblocker claim. there could be both. in fact, two death-free nights are more likely if we have both, since guardians often have restrictions like &quot;can&#039;t guard the same player two nights in a row&quot;<br /><br />but what do i know

				That is the worst abuse of calling something WIFOM i&#039;ve ever heard.<br /><br />WIFOM is where your perception of the situation affect the state of the situation, which in turn affects your perception. the rules and roles were created at the start and will never change.<br /><br /><br />What I said was a good way to think about the situation.

				I mean, we don&#039;t have any data regarding how likely it is for narwhal to have done something misbalanced, if it even is misbalanced. If we needed to specifically target the person submitted the night kill, it wouldn&#039;t be that overpowered.<br /><br />Your argument basically boils down to &quot;narwhal wouldn&#039;t do that as a host&quot; and, honestly, he might. people make a lot of mistakes or miscalculations as host, especially in games this complex, and trying to predict which actions are or aren&#039;t reasonable is pretty much up in the air.<br /><br />really any situation in which you try to use what a person would or wouldn&#039;t do as some particular role is pretty WIFOM-y.

				That&#039;s definitely a fair point. I have no idea how many wolves are out there, and there are a number of things that could indicate a third wolf. I definitely feel some temptation to eliminate one possible third wolf candidate, just to keep a hold on Iron and get that additional view.

				So it says nothing about that, but im assuming that wolves can still vote to NK, which makes sense, but if we kill the last wolf and then MY wolf is left, its considered dead.<br /><br />Also, Wolves, if I die, and have one of your partners, they die too. So be warned.

				okay yes so lymric this makes sense. it&#039;s a way to possibly kill two wolves. <br /><br />xazarus first, then iron in the night<br /><br /><br />you get a free kill on a wolf and also kill another suspect in the process, because look-<br /><br /><br />if you believe eep/yeagz, it means you&#039;re human, i&#039;m human, they&#039;re human, and iron is wolf, and any other wolves would be either xazarus or triantalis<br /><br />so take out one of them now while you can to lower the risk of you, eep, or yeagz dying at night.

				Personally I think that it is a little bit of cheating to look at that stuff while a game is going on. But nothing is stated about it in the rules, so I guess go ahead and look. :/<br /><br />I guess I can be in favor of the day ending sooner. Nothing much going on at all.

				Fuck it. you guys aren&#039;t going to change your minds about iron.<br /><br />you guys lynch Iron. Game over. Endgame condition met: All Party Poopers have been exterminated. <br /><br />the WINNERS: Lymric, eep, yeagz, Trientalis, xazarus <br /><br /><br />Before the reveal, a few words. <br />I want to apologize to the Party Poopers. I knew that they were at a disadvantage from the beginning, due to the unique mechanic I set up for them. I tried to make up for it by giving Innocent Party Goers less and less incentive to look out for the human team. <br />This being my first game, however, I made a number of mistakes. I severely, grossly underestimated epp/yeagz. I honestly don&#039;t even know what I was thinking. Because no single wolf was responsible for the NK, I ended up letting yeagz completely dominate them. That system also needed to be thought out a bit more, obviously. <br />the balance was pretty shitty. My bad. I hope you guys had fun regardless. It was fun to watch. Except for the parts where people used the logic &quot;the game can&#039;t possibly be that badly balanced, so that can&#039;t be true.&quot; It WAS that bad. Embarrassing.<br /><br />the concept of the game was to break down the entire idea of human team vs wolf team. It didn&#039;t make any sense to me, from a story telling perspective, that a vanilla would be willing to sacrifice themselves on D1 for the team. I wanted to bring the game closer to real human behavior, and that meant putting the individual over the team, in my head. Conceptually, I think the game was a magnificent success and I&#039;m very proud.&nbsp; I loved when you guys brushed on this stuff, like eep/yeagz possibly playing both sides, like the point where you threw around the idea of working with the wolves to basically choose who was alive at endgame. I think there were a few more similar things. That stuff was awesome and exactly what I was aiming for. <br /><br />Anyway. the deets. Sorry for the annoying formatting, copy-paste from notepad has it&#039;s downsides. <br /><br />Swoop: Party Pooper, Wuss<br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">you are swoopdoggydog<br />Fucked up names we give our children, right? <br /><br />you are a PARTY POOPER. you, iron, and liftedpixel have been <br /><br />trying to relieve your utopian boredom by pulling ye olde <br /><br />innocent pranks, but eventually that loses it&#039;s appeal. the <br /><br />thrill is gone, you guys aren&#039;t cute any more, and it&#039;s time for <br /><br />something more. However, you are also a WUSS. X and X killed <br /><br />what&#039;s-her-name and you are freaking the fuck out about it. <br /><br />Things have gone way too far. This was fun before but you are in <br /><br />way over your head. you never meant for this to happen. you <br /><br />really kind of just wanted to enjoy Narwhal&#039;s kick ass party. <br /><br />the band was friggen killing it. No pun intended. Anyway there&#039;s <br /><br />no turning back now. you are innocent no longer. There&#039;s only <br /><br />one way to get out of this ahead: help bring those PARTY POOPERS <br /><br />to justice. Unfortunately they&#039;ll kill you dead if they figure <br /><br />out what you&#039;re up to. <br /><br />Stuff you really need to know that I&#039;m too lazy to write shitty <br /><br />flavor for.<br />- you&#039;re the WUSS. <br />- you win if and only if you are alive at endgame and the rest <br /><br />of the PARTY POOPERS are not. <br /><br />Transcribed below is the standard PARTY POOPER PM.<br />you are X<br />Fucked up names we give our children, right? <br /><br />you are a PARTY POOPER. you, X, and X have been trying to <br /><br />relieve your utopian boredom by pulling ye olde innocent pranks, <br /><br />but eventually that loses it&#039;s appeal. the thrill is gone, you <br /><br />guys aren&#039;t cute any more, and it&#039;s time for something more. So <br /><br />you killed whats-her-name. Right in the middle of Narwhal&#039;s <br /><br />party. you fucking bastard. But really, what&#039;s the big deal? you <br /><br />have no concept of death. Nor of crime, nor punishment. But here <br /><br />is a new thrill. Some people at this party don&#039;t get it though, <br /><br />and are going to try to make you stop. Blah blah blah losers. <br /><br />Stuff you really need to know that I&#039;m too lazy to write shitty <br /><br />flavor for. <br />- There are three PARTY POOPERS, but one of them is also a WUSS. <br /><br />you are not the WUSS. the WUSS didn&#039;t want things to go this <br /><br />far, is in over his head.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- you can win without killing the WUSS. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the WUSS wins when you and your fellow properly-macho <br /><br />PARTY POOPER are dead.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- you can communicate privately with the other two PARTY <br /><br />POOPERS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the game in any way you choose. <br />- you saw someone bring a weapon. Watch out for heroes. <br />- Each PARTY POOPER submits a vote for an NK target each night. <br /><br />If one player receives two or three votes, that player is <br /><br />targeted. If no player receives two votes (i.e. three way tie), <br /><br />the tie is resolved in mysterious ways that only I understand.<br />- you win when the PARTY POOPERS outnumber the INNOCENT PARTY <br /><br />GOERS.<br />- Good luck chaps. <br /><br /><br />Transcribed below is the vanilla PM.<br />you are X<br />Fucked up names we give our children, right?<br /><br />you are an INNOCENT PARTY GOER. <br />you&#039;re not actually sure where you are, how you got here, or how <br /><br />long you&#039;ve been here.<br />you&#039;re not sure who the host of this party is and you&#039;re not <br /><br />sure you&#039;ve met any of the guests before, either. <br />All you know is that this was a good fucking party before the <br /><br />whats-her-name shit went down. <br /><br />Good luck, and don&#039;t take the brown acid. <br /><br /></div></div><br />Vanilla Party Poopers: Iron, Liftedpixel<br /><br />Adderall4all: Wannabe<br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">you are adderallforall<br />Fucked up names we give our children, right?<br /><br />you are an INNOCENT PARTY GOER. <br />you&#039;re not actually sure where you are, how you got here, or how long you&#039;ve been here.<br />you&#039;re not sure who the host of this party is and you&#039;re not sure you&#039;ve met any of the guests before, either. <br />All you know is that this was a good fucking party.

Sure, no one has died even by accident in like, forty seven passes of Haley&#039;s comet, but you still surround your property in barbed wire and vicious dogs and keep your bunker well stocked with supplies. Narwhal is known for throwing unbelievable parties; you&#039;re not known for being a fool. So you brought a veritable arsenal. And for once, you were right. If those shitbag PARTY POOPERS think they are going to get one past you, they are sorely mistaken. you&#039;ve been waiting for this day for literally ages. Eons. Significant historical periods. you have a reputation to uphold. Of course, once the deed is done, you&#039;ll have to drop the aresenal in the incinerator to hide the evidence, but there&#039;s more where that came from, in your bunker, which is exactly where you&#039;re going the moment this mess is sorted out and this ridiculous party is over.<br /><br />- During any one night you can choose a target.<br />- Dat target done dies.<br />- One shot, one chance.<br />- you win if and only if the target that you kill is a PARTY POOPER.&nbsp; <br />- Don&#039;t fuck it up. </div></div><br />Eep: Disillusioned<br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">you are eep<br />Fucked up names we give our children, right?<br /><br />you are an INNOCENT PARTY GOER. you are in a relationship with yeagz. a really, really steady relationship.

But the thing is, when you&#039;ve been with someone for that long, when you know them that well, with all their faults, quirks, annoying relatives, can you really love them? It all gets stale after a few thousand years. Yeagz stopped surprising you....you don&#039;t know when. you read people easily in the first place. you read yeagz like a book and you played them like a fiddle and now you&#039;re stuck with them at this ridiculous party. Everyone is so predictable when they&#039;ve been set in their ways for millenia. you see right through them. <br /><br />- Choose a target each night<br />- I tell you if that person is a PARTY POOPER or an INNOCENT PARTY GOER.<br />- you can communicate privately with X using subtly raised eyebrows across the room. Or PMs. Your call. <br />- yeagz still loves you. Like a lot. Yeagz is an INNOCENT PARTY GOER like you.

Twenty thousand years? you have no idea. the whole not really caring about time thing. Point is, you&#039;ve been together longer than your memory lasts and you&#039;ve loved every single minute of it. Bonds like that can&#039;t be broken, not by some pathetic PARTY POOPER. you&#039;d do anything, like hold a dude down in full nelson all night. Which you&#039;re going to do, because less than 100% isn&#039;t enough for this kind of relationship. you&#039;re a COCKBLOCK.<br /><br />- Choose one target each night.<br />- That target doesn&#039;t get to do anything that they might have done that night.<br />- you can communicate with eep privately.<br />- eep is definitely an INNOCENT PARTY GOER, I promise. <br />- you win if and only if both you and eep are alive at endgame.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div></div><br />Lymric: Idealist<br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">you are Lymric<br />Fucked up names we give our children, right?<br /><br />you are an INNOCENT PARTY GOER. you are also an IDEALIST. you are certainly all in favor of bringing these horrible PARTY POOPERS to justice, but we don&#039;t live in an eye-for-an-eye world here. Killing them won&#039;t bring whats-her-name back. Murder is the greatest crime imaginable in an immortal world. No one deserves that, and you can&#039;t allow it, if it&#039;s within your power to stop. Momma raised you to be the better person, now go out and show &#039;em how big you are.<br /><br />So here&#039;s how this role works. At the end of day 1, you can choose to incarcerate the lynch victim. If you do so, the lynch candidate won&#039;t die. And the end of day 2, you can choose to either keep the D1 lynch candidate in custody, or release him/her and take the new candidate into custody. People released from custody to the mob die instantly. Same crap on day 3 and etcetera. you may only have one person in custody at any given time. you may not release a person from custody before the day ends. People in custody can still post in the game thread, can speak to you and only you privately, and cannot vote for the lynch. <br /><br />- you win if and only if a PARTY POOPER is in custody at the end of the game. <br />- you must be alive to win. <br />- If you die, your prisoner is released from custody and dies instantly.<br />- For the purposes of endgame counts, your prisoner is dead.&nbsp; </div></div><br />Matt Miller: the Dick<br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">you are matt miller<br />Fucked up names we give our children, right?<br /><br />you are an INNOCENT PARTY GOER. <br />Well, nearly innocent. you and xazarus have been enemies for a long, long time.

				Well I stopped doing more than skimming by the end. Too much to keep track of when you&#039;ve lost already.<br /><br />I liked my role and wish I had a chance to use it. I PM&#039;d Narwhal that if I were to have killed someone N1 it would&#039;ve been guy, but I guess that&#039;s why you wait to make those kinds of decisions. Pixel and Swoop were on my radar too though.<br /><br />Most of all I looked forward to what I&#039;d do after getting my kill in, namely mess around and try to spread as much confusion as possible.

				Id like to say the reason I knew Eep was human was because she said pretty early on that she was an INNOCENT PARTY GOER, which is cool because maybe people didn&#039;t catch it, but that&#039;s the same phrasing that everyone else got in their PMs so I kinda thought it was dumb because I thought maybe that&#039;s almost quoting PMs? Like if everyone got INNOCENT PARTY GOER in their PMs then its like a way of knowing because a wolf wouldn&#039;t know that that was the phrasing. Im not sure, it kinda made me mad for some reason, but then everyone was doing it so later it didn&#039;t matter, but I just thought it was shitty for some reason.<br /><br />But I also thought hey maybe she could&#039;ve gotten lucky with the phrasing so I didn&#039;t say anything.

				I&#039;m not gonna lie, having god-like powers was pretty sweet. For luck to balance out, I&#039;ll probably be vanilla or D1 lynched for the next few games, haha.<br /><br />I really liked the idealist/necromancer role! There&#039;s a lot of potential there.<br /><br />Seeing the wuss fully play out would have been cool too. Maybe next time don&#039;t inform the other wolves that there is a double-crosser in their midst? That way the wuss can try to persuade them to make crappy choices for NK&#039;s.<br /><br />What was the mechanic for breaking lynch ties? If there was a tie between townies and wolves, did the wolf have to eat the hemlock?<br /><br />Lastly, I think I&#039;m gonna have to host a TWG after getting some more experience on the boards. This is a fun crew to play with! :)

				I was REALLY bummed about the Wuss too. I told them about it because I WANTED to make them distrust each other. As a wolf you can sometimes become complacent; this was giving them something to work towards figuring out. Also, the idea of a true double agent who had to play both sides was really cool.<br /><br />the tie breaking was a compli fucking cated system based on weighing votes. If, for instance, there was a tie between iron and guy, and eep voted for iron and then switched to guy, her vote for guy would carry a bit more weight.<br />Next time I&#039;d go with something more simple because the system was pretty ponderous and not worth the effort. Sucks that the wolves managed to get the shit end of the stick both times. <br /><br />Cool! Glad you had fun.

				It made sense from a flavor perspective. There were only really two wolves, and if you hit one of them, I would assume the the wuss would basically assist in the block. Blocking the wuss would have not affected the NK. <br /><br />Also, in the event of a three way wolf tie (which theoretically might have happened due to distrust) then the wuss would be the deciding vote, and if any wolf voted to NK any other wolf, that would have happened. <br /><br />Fuck if I know what would have happened if two wolves tried to kill each other at the same time.
