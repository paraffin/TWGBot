				i think how i will do it to make it easier for everyone (and this time is flexible so if you guys agree on a different time that works better for everyone that&#039;s fine with me) is to have phases end at midgnight EST<br /><br />but then i won&#039;t advance the phase until around 6 or 7am est because that&#039;s when i can<br /><br />so days will start at 7am (the first one will be longer) and run two and a half days until the next midnight est. any votes counted after that will not be counted, but talking is okay<br /><br />don&#039;t send pms for night abilities until after i change the phase. that way there won&#039;t be any issues if anyone miscounts votes and uses an ability thinking someone died when they didn&#039;t<br /><br />then nights will last probably either one or two days (7am-7am) depending on how you guys feel about that. i think one day would be enough but if you want more i can change that.<br /><br />anyway again the ending time of midnight is flexible and doesn&#039;t really matter to me. you guys can discuss and change it to whatever, but phases (day-&gt;night, night-&gt;day) will always change sometime between 6am and 8am EST

				Ah yes, well, hello, sorry for being late in all this, but I just had to take care of a terrible mess. The chemistry of cements is actually quite fascinating when you think about it... you take a dry powder, add water (which normally makes things more fluid), and in doing so, you create a chemical reaction that results in a big chunky solid thing! A bad of cement powder is like a portable wall! Or stairs! Or a toilet, if you&#039;ve got the plumbing. AH! Who needs plumbing? Well, okay, a lot of people do BUT that&#039;s digressing and besides the point anyhow.<br /><br />So I&#039;m thinking we need to take out <strong>eep</strong> because she is not to be trusted and it also seems like a very &quot;bad guy&quot; thing to do, to be the one who starts throwing around accusations. I mean, maybe the good guys do that, I&#039;m not exactly an expert on every culture, but this is a trend I&#039;ve noticed in my travels: people generally don&#039;t make accusations calling the integrity of others into question unless they have a reason.

				My major concern with this game is that Guy stated that just because your character wasn&#039;t a wolf in a previous game doesn&#039;t make them not a wolf in this game.

				Haplo, I agree that that_kid&#039;s vote is crap (it&#039;s based on a misunderstanding), but I also think your Dragon vote is crap (it isn&#039;t based on anything). He didn&#039;t draw any negative attention at all except for yours (correct me if I&#039;m wrong here) since we all realize (by this point at least... I hope...) that roles are meaningless and most of us are capable of recognizing a harmless joke when we see one. Besides, it&#039;s not like he hasn&#039;t posted anything else for you to analyze. Power role, vanilla or wolf, a player who actually plays is more valuable than one who pretends to.

				I am able to check-in. I&#039;m just saying that I won&#039;t be as active as I normally am. <br /><br />What I was talking about earlier was the fact that I believe Aj and I are the only people who haven&#039;t voted yet and by putting Haplo at 3 votes, Aj would be able to vote for anyone kill Haplo based on the newest voting rule. For this reason, I held back my vote because I want Day 1 to last longer because it is easier to check-up on a game when night-kills aren&#039;t happening yet.

				So, just to go through the list:<br /><br />1. haplo - probably human.<br />2. dieter - i lean towards human with him, but i don&#039;t think i&#039;ve ever seen him play wolf, so it&#039;s hard to tell<br />3. iron - being unusually calm and unaffected by most things in the game. I&#039;m inclined to say wolf.<br />4. liquidangel - made a comment suggesting that ribos could have some sort of special power because he just went and voted for me. This is, of course, confusing powers for roles, etc, but I wonder whether that sort of cautiousness about potential roles could be a wolfish tendency. I lean slightly towards wolf.<br />5. that_kid - as a wolf, tends to breed chaos. He&#039;s been playing up the potential confusion about powers and roles being disconnected, which could lead to quite a bit of chaos.<br />6. dr.agon - made a joke about being a wolf which could be the sort of joke you make because it&#039;s actually true. it could also honestly just be his role, but not his power, which would be strange but not out of the question. I don&#039;t think I want to lynch him.<br />7. eep - meep<br />8. aj - I am pretty certain that he is not a wolf, because, from what I can tell, he plays a pretty active wolf who pushes bandwagons on human players, and an uncertain human unless he has some sort of special power that would give him more info. Seeing as it&#039;s day 1, he would only have special info as a wolf, so probably he&#039;s human.<br />9. enig.matic - no idea<br />10. death butt - doing some weird things but honestly he is just a shady muthafucka irl so probably he&#039;s human.<br />11. ribos - he cast a sort of &quot;token vote&quot; on me and then keeps making excuses for why he&#039;s largely absent. whether he&#039;s human or wolf, this doesn&#039;t sit well with me.<br /><br />So, on a first run-through, I&#039;d be happiest lynching one of the following, in no particular order:<br />ribos<br />iron<br />liquidangel<br />that_kid<br /><br />And now, I&#039;m going to walk away from this for a bit and look through it again later to see if i find something different that can narrow that list down.<br /><br />Also, random question for liquidangel: did you ever per chance play games on bemanistyle as archangel something or other?

				<strong>TLDR:</strong> voting<strong> that_kid</strong> because of, in no particular order,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a) bandwagoning/sheeping on Haplo, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b) putting words in Haplo&#039;s mouth,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c) going back on himself and covering his tracks by saying he was only foolin&#039;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d) spreading confusion about roles v powers and vote count, and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(e) posting more than playing.<br /><br /><hr /><br />The fact that Haplo was encouraging everyone to vote Dr Agon is still fishy, but I don&#039;t think two votes on him are warranted at this point. He hasn&#039;t changed under pressure or incriminated himself any further and I can&#039;t very well vote him just for making a poor argument. As eep said he&#039;s being too stubbornly inactive to actually be a wolf.<br /><br />Therefore I will change my vote to my new top target; <strong>that_kid</strong>. I can&#039;t tell you if I became suspicious of him on my own or if Dr Agon and eep&#039;s suspicions were what put him on my radar, but he&#039;s had my attention for a while now.

				<strong>TLDR</strong> Why voting for That_Kid is a bad idea: or how I learned to stop listening to stop being mad and have a good time at gametown<br /><br />(a) I legitimately didn&#039;t know Haplo already had a vote. I picked him because 1.) I though about that time he tried to take a dump on me when we were both wolves. 2.) Thinking about how funny it would be if Guy did make him a wolf cause that one game that Haplo messed up on. Yes, bad logic but Death Butt is correct that, &quot;lol lol lolz guys i&#039;m just goofin.&quot;<br />(b) Haplo said &quot;does nothing to affect the amount of activity i engage in&quot; which I took as him saying inactive. If you choose not to see it as thus that&#039;s fine, but don&#039;t put words into my mouth into Haplos mouth. That&#039;s in poor taste (haha puns).<br />(c) I don&#039;t remember being serious about anything.<br />(d) I&#039;m fishing for information. If you don&#039;t like my tactics then butt (there are those darned puns again) out as they work for me.<br />(e) I forgot that the only playstyle for this game is to hide in the shadows and not say anything (reminds me of someone, although I can&#039;t place my finger on whom).

				Hehe, but, more seriously, a good response; I&#039;ll have to think about it. Vote stays where it is for now. It is also good to see a vote on me; I&#039;d start feeling antsy if <em>nobody</em> voted me first day in. Gotta get the juices flowing, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, some preliminary responses:<br /><br />First off, you did vote for LiquidAngel on page 6, so this would be your third vote.<br /><br />Second,<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: that_dude</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">By the way I was lying when I said I&#039;ve got a normal role and have no means of proving myself</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about but it sounds like you&#039;re soft-claiming a power role?<br /><br />That&#039;s all for now, I guess.

				Oh, you meant role as in role role, not power role. Got it. What is it?<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t have anything personally against you, as you seem to believe. Personally I&#039;d prefer it if you turned out to be human. I&#039;d prefer it if we were all human. Do we really have to kill each other? :(

				Holy shit. So many things happened. Ok, I did not know that 4 people hadn&#039;t voted yet. I never actually counted, but I thought that AJ and I were the only two who hadn&#039;t, so I was abstaining my vote so he couldn&#039;t snipe one, but I see it isn&#039;t quite as dire now, and the day now has a solid end time.<br /><br />Second of all. I don&#039;t like that_kid&#039;s claim, but I&#039;m not willing to kill a potential special on Day 1. It felt as though he backed into it harder than he needed to. The butt wasn&#039;t really going at him hard enough to warrant a claim. Sure he&#039;s had 2 votes, he still has plenty of time, and coming out almost made it seem like a last ditch effort in surviving (which will probably work because there is no point in risking a kill like that this early) when he didn&#039;t really need to pull out that card yet. <br /><br />I&#039;m still not feelin&#039; Haplo. It felt as though he was trying a bit too hard earlier to cover up things that didn&#039;t need to be covered up (such as why he started posting). He then jumped quickly on that_kid after death butt&#039;s post, and even after that_kid made a soft claim about having a role. I don&#039;t see much point in ending the day quickly, and would rather it go on longer. The longer day 1 goes, the more discussion happens, and we can get even more information before having one of us killed. Using &quot;ending the day&quot; as a reason for jumping on that_kid just does not sit well with me.<br /><br />So, <strong>Haplo</strong>.

Just a result of clicking &quot;modify&quot; instead of &quot;insert quote&quot; and then presumably confusing my tabs.

According to him, he was soft-claiming a power role when he responded to my vote/post;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,916.msg35448.html#msg35448">Quote from: That_Kid on June 08, 2012, 07:58:45 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">By the way I was lying when I said I&#039;ve got a normal role and have no means of proving myself.

At this point in the game nobody would have blinked if he clarified in his next post that this wasn&#039;t a power claim, so even after making this post, even after Dr Agon assuming it was a power claim, he could have easily denied that. Instead he chose to say it was a power claim right off the bat, well before it was necessary. Nothing forced him into it.<br /><br />At the same time, that_kid&#039;s narrative about why he claimed and stuff works well enough that I&#039;m also hesitant to lynch him. I agree that haplo is the next best candidate, and at the very least is almost definitely not a power role, but before I change my vote to him I want that_kid to guarantee that he will be able to prove his claim after tonight&#039;s night action. It&#039;s still too early for him to make a hard claim if it can helped, so I think that&#039;s a decent solution.

				I am posting more now. I voted for Haplo with an explanation, and gave my thoughts on that_kid. I may have posted about as much as you have in this game, but my activity spike is not going to last very long and isn&#039;t going to be much of a spike. I am currently packing all of my shit up to move to Boston this Friday. I won&#039;t be in Ohio again until Thanksgiving, and then not again until Christmas, so I&#039;m spending most of this week with people, packing, and driving. I can still participate, but it will probably be about as much as I have been.

				In other words, I completely understand if you want to kill me because I will be at most half-active for the next week or so. That&#039;s why I was attempting to delay day 1 as long as possible. Gives humans more time to discuss things, and make a more informed day 1 lynch. It also would allow me the time catch up without having night kills thrown into the mix.

				<strong>unvote</strong>. You&#039;re dead tomorrow if you don&#039;t have some damn good evidence, though.<br /><br />Not switching to haplo yet because I don&#039;t know if that would end the game or not, plus I&#039;m starting to lean on the side of human for him. That&#039;s annoying because I haven&#039;t really pushed anyone else today, so for most of the rest of you I have very little to go on and not much time to change that, especially as I don&#039;t have much time at all to play today. <br /><br />I won&#039;t try and stop a haplo lynch and might even throw my vote in if it&#039;s necessary (say, to stop that_kid from being lynched), but my gut tells me he&#039;s probably just a vanilla human.

				I&#039;m pretty certain that haplo is human because i thiiink he tends to be more aggressive as a wolf.<br /><br />that_kid, can you confirm alignment, or just power?<br /><br />i think that aj is not a wolf because he definitely looks for opportunities to push things on to other players as a wolf; aj has not been doing that.<br /><br />the only player who i don&#039;t think any of us have a read on, and who has been reliably, totally inactive, has been ribos. so this is me, encouraging everyone to use day 1 to get rid of an inactive, because it will suck to have a player like that around for the rest of the day.

				This is probably the last post I&#039;ll make except for checking in a bit before the day ends.

				Just to clarify, and perhaps Dieter will agree, I think Dieter is pointing out that I am normally a huge list-maker (and could possibly be considered LESS aggressive this game).<br /><br />And he&#039;s entirely right. i would love to be a list maker. I actually have some lists but they are on the back of some receipts and are more relevant to tomorrow, if tonight goes as it appears to be. Tomorrow they can get typed up if they&#039;re still relevant. They&#039;re not judges of character, as most people make on D1; they are evaluations of clues.

				Yes, most of those are inactives. The reason for that is that to me, most of the rest of you have so far struck me as human not with the quantity but the content of your posts. I am of course completely willing to reconsider any of these reads, and some of them are much weaker than others. Anyway, it&#039;s only day one, so it&#039;s still early to take these very seriously.<br /><br />At this point I don&#039;t have much else to add.<br /><br />that_kid: as was asked, will your demonstration prove your alignment?

				my list was about tha kid. hs particular claim lines up with all his clues except the one where he said he was fom a game with normal rules. which he hadsince rescinded. i could easily guess d1 that XV would be his claim. nothing else in the metadata matches well. i cn post my full work later tonight hopefully though it is nothing ayone else couldnt reproduce given time. <br /><br />that kid arely has hero powers and vanilla flavored games are rare. i have a list of what hints you can disrgad and what rolclaim theyd be. in summary,sane seer fit the most clues. cicilian makes little sensehough of course it is te mot comon role. wolf is next. his other hero powers were dumb but in my game he was once a vig<br /><br />i think the mportant thing to note is that there was no chance of him claiming arole that didnt leave iggleroom in the case of the right night death.

				aw, who&#039;s got da cutest iggleroom?<br /><br />i have een looking at what mr butt had been up to sincehe is obviously our ony cnfirmed human. in fact he is the only thing even close. unfortunately i top his list though i think that is, as he says later, because he wanted to pu pressure somewhere on limited time and though i would respond. <br /><br />death butt voted for haplo, that kid, enig, and myself. for 4 different reasons. <br /><br />the only vtes on him were thatkid (in a no u manner) and dragon for reasons not fully explained. a possible motive for the kill thouh perhaps a sloppy one.<br /><br />deathbutt said, qute from memory, &quot;you&#039;re dead tomorrow if you don&#039;t have some damn good evidence&quot; about thatkid. thus i think our confirmed human would have voted thatkid today. mething to consider.<br /><br />i don&#039;t hink any of this should be taken confidently because it soundslike deathy was operating on guesswork. but its some of the best data we hae for analysis atm other than the hard claim. i&#039;d encourage people to use it in their analyses. <br /><br />votng patterns seem farly scattered though maybe a bit of data to lend credence to certain accusations as we go.&nbsp; i have a gut feling about one possibility and it would be great if the situation i have in mind comes up. i dont nomally have gut feelings though haha. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,916.msg35503.html#msg35503">Quote from: dead butt on June 11, 2012, 07:02:14 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is probably the last post I&#039;ll make except for checking in a bit before the day ends.

				i smell either a gameable system or a lie either gives humans power. both seers view the same person. next day post your answers in a cryptographed manner. once both have done so both relese the key. <br /><br />this establishes if there is a wolf seer.<br /><br /><br />actually his is not as good as i thought because if both pass the test then we still have to lync both for a guarantee wolf lynch plus it costs an extra day. and there is the small chance of two huma seers. but there mut be some way to&nbsp; benfit.

				Well this is some shit. This is EXACTLY the reason I was trying to postpone day 1 as long as possible. I don&#039;t have the time right now to go check out that_kid and eep like I normally would, so I kind of have to go off of memory in what has happened in this thread. It is very unlikely that we have 2 good seers, so one of them is probably lying. As eep said, since they both had the same view, they can&#039;t be insane (unless one of them has some percent chance to be right or wrong).<br /><br />If that is the case then iron&#039;s system is completely broken. If one of them has a 50% chance to get it wrong (and they don&#039;t know they have that chance) then they will mostly likely be lynched tomorrow. Really based on iron&#039;s post eep is the safest kill right now, but counterclaiming is an incredibly risky move for a wolf, and would be very hard to pull off on day 2. <br /><br />I really don&#039;t believe that_kid. He saved himself yesterday by claiming he had a role that could be verified (and acted like it was a sure thing), but then when the time came he conveniently viewed the nightkill. It is very odd that eep also chose the nightkill instead of ribos who she seems to hate a lot this game. The whole situation is fishy, and the only real reason I don&#039;t like that_kid a lot more than eep is because this was his whole argument to keep him on day 1 and it fell through today.<br /><br />I need to see more before voting.

				Hey fuck you Dieter.<br /><br />Anyways on a more serious note: I&#039;m slightly suspicious of eep and that_kid and how they introduced this whole dual seer thing. It&#039;s a possibility especially given that guy is the creator of this twg, but eh.<br /><br />As for everyone else, lynching an inactive d2 is still somewhat out of the question. Given my power, I can say that we&#039;re down two humans. So out of the 9 left, given how balance &quot;could&quot; be (it varies) I think we have about 3 days left, 4 days if we aren&#039;t retarded. So as it stands, Haplo and death butt were humans, and we&#039;re dumb as hell. [sidebar: it&#039;s funny that I bitch about meta on d1 but d2 I&#039;m all about that shit. What am I, a fag?]

				Correct. When there are counterclaims. Usually the best course of action is to kill both players to ensure you got the wolf. Of course, you usually don&#039;t do this until later in the game as a sort of last resort. At this point that_kid seems like the more believable seer who just had bad luck, but I&#039;m only saying that because he is the one who presented any information. Eep just kind of said, &quot;yea, me too.&quot; Honestly though, this is just because she had no reason to say the information before that_kid. Why claim seer when all you&#039;ve viewed is a dead guy?<br /><br />As far as the enigmatic priest goes, I highly doubt that we have 2 seers even if they have a failure rate. 2 seers + 1 priest? If there are more roles, I would assume 3 wolves to balance out the powers.

				unless part of the balance is the assumed doubt on the seers for each other.&nbsp; and yes eep, I agree it is a stupid move, but a stupid move seems more likely to me (no offense) than a stupid setup (2 seers).&nbsp; and I will admit it is a gut feeling, but that_kid strikes me as a wolf and you have to be a wolf in almost any scenario except the one I refuse to believe. <br /><br />maybe its just fresh on my mind because my role flavor is from it, but someone somewhere suggested wolves not knowing each other and dueling packs is a possibility.&nbsp; it could also explain a sorcerer viewing the night kill

				Eep about AJ is pretty much spot on. I&#039;m not saying that absolves AJ from being a wolf, but he certainly isn&#039;t playing/posting like one.<br /><br />As for me coming out about a power role, suspicions of be have always been closer to wolf than ally. I figure if everyone is laying their chips on the line, then given potential balances it seems marginally okay if I out myself along with you guys much to my dismay.<br /><br />The only people that come to my attention for interest are Dr.agon and dieter really. Everyone else is either crazy inactive or aren&#039;t acting remotely like wolves. (eg. Dieter has been in and out with some pretty good posts, but they&#039;re more akin to pointing out the obvious. Dr.agon does the same thing but in a far more critical tone)

				Okay, so a lot has happened since i last read the thread. I don&#039;t know about eep vs thatkid just yet, but many good points have been raised so far.<br /><br />The thing that jumped out to me: why did enigmatic claim priest when it doesn&#039;t really help us as a team? No seriously - we now have 3 people on day 2 that are telling us death butt was a human.<br /><br />Okay, now we know that supposedly haplo was human. I find that believable, but why bring this up right now when the bad guys are able to maneuver around it? I don&#039;t buy the reasoning that enigmatic needed to defend himself - he only had one vote, and he thinks that merits coming out with his role?<br /><br />This whole situation is off...

				I like the idea of using enig to confirm alignment, but I pretty hard don&#039;t like his claim. There was no purpose to come out with it yet, and it gives only information that wolves would know anyway (the addition of the &quot;good fight&quot; part can just be a lie based on what that_kid said). Also, priest is one of those roles that rarely pops up in a game and is a fairly safe claim for a wolf. I believe Phil claimed priest in a game where he was a wolf, and got away with it. If all three of these are humans, then there is a very high chance of 3 wolves which will throw off iron&#039;s analysis of how voting could go in the following days. We should still be able to survive today though without killing any of them. A good idea would be to have that_kid and eep view enig. (Hopefully guardian exists to protect him.) That way we will have at least 1 &quot;seer&quot; alive to tell us his alignment. Then tomorrow, if enig is confirmed, we can kill one of the seers to get alignment, and most likely know which one is the human. <br /><br />As far as who to kill today goes, I don&#039;t like ribos or aj either. In fact, has aj even been online in the past week? He might just be dead weight to the humans.

				eeps lst point is a great one. though enig should confirm it works every lynch. it means we could kill just one seer today then have a few alignments the next day. exact number depending on how the guardian does and what we find out. i think enig has the sae chance to nt be nkd as a seer: it would confirm him.<br /><br />liquids idea is also pretty good. i only disagree in hat i think a priest coming out during battling seers is a great time.

				the willingness of so many people to lynch AJ makes me believe he&#039;s probably human. i agree with liquidcraig&#039;s analysis that engimatic is probably wolf, but that we&#039;re best off leaving some/all of them alive for today. <br /><br />craig, what makes ribos a bad lynch? i would probably rather lynch him or maybe iron or any of the remaining people (until of course one/all of them end up claiming roles too...).<br /><br />also, i&#039;ll say that liquidcraig comes off as a good guy based on that post. :thumbsup:<br /><br />i disagree with iron. priest coming out added basically nothing to the conversation. all we know now is that haplo was probably a good guy. oh yeah, and that death butt was DEFINITELY human. terrible timing.

				Okay, I don&#039;t think I really believe Enig right now.&nbsp; Dieter pointed out most of the reasons why already, but it seems to me that it is a way of pushing disbelief on the fact that there could be 2 seers as there is a small possibility of 2 seers and a priest.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really think its a good idea to not lynch that_kid, the AJ thing rings slightly true, but dieter defending AJ would count as someone being unwilling to lynch him.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see dieter as a likely wolf, and dieter with AJ even less likely so I&#039;ll give him a pass and say AJ is unlikely.<br /><br />and I&#039;m not sure I like liquid&#039;s plan because he has now picked 2 seer views, a guard, and is trying to pick the lynch.&nbsp; that seems wolfy to me as well.&nbsp; that is just too much stuff to make public and choosing the use of the roles is a wolf move more than a human move.&nbsp; if they have the role they are human, do what you think is right because that is guaranteed to be more human driven than any public choice.<br /><br />that said, I think the wolves scenarios in likelyhood (personal oppinion) very well could be eep and enig, enig and other, eep and other, or 3 wolves crapshoot right now, I am willing to try and the likely wolves escape a lynch for tonight and am willing to resort to stopping the 3 crapshoot and vote for <strong>liquid</strong>

				lets come up with a list of suspicious people who haven&#039;t claimed.<br /><br />Dr. Agon (claimed wolf, but left it at that so maybe I&#039;m not a good view)<br /><br />Iron (sort of hinted, but I never picked up on what he hinted at) <br /><br />Liquid (claimed Kyle Craig so maybe not a good choice as we may already know some shut about him)<br /><br />Dieter (no claim that I can tell)<br /><br />Enig (claimed priest, but the plan liquid had wasn&#039;t actually all that awful, just too direct to me)<br /><br />AJ (no claim or anything really so anything you can give us is new information)<br /><br />Ribos (hinted at something according to others, but I just thought it was his being weird.&nbsp; anything is probably new.)<br /><br />in conclusion, I would recommend choosing between Dieter, AJ, and Ribos, but I wouldn&#039;t be opposed to a Dr. Agon or Enig view.<br /><br />I do think it would be better for both of you to view the same person, but that person may be targeted if we make it public which one it is and I am doubting we have a guardian.<br /><br />I do believe that the &quot;seers&quot; are not likely to be targeted as we currently doubt either seers humanity and the same goes for enig really, but I don&#039;t have a full grasp on what the situation actually is.

				&nbsp;I have to say, after that last post I&#039;m not liking <strong>ribos</strong>. He pops up every now and then to maintain some semblance of being a player, but the stuff he writes is mostly just filler and nonsensical. It doesn&#039;t add to the discussion and if anything only serves to slow us down.<br /><br />Besides... is AJ even alive anymore? I don&#039;t think he&#039;s even been on since Day 1.

				eh. I typically go with inactives as human, unless it is clear that they have been active outside of the thread. This is just because I feel like a wolf would be more compelled to play that game. That&#039;s why I typically go after active-ish players. In the case of ribos I explained that he is somewhat feigning inactivity. He doesn&#039;t really post during the day, and what he does post is next to useless.

				a true inactive should not be considered human, but also should not be assumed wolf.<br /><br />just go with what seems right, 9 players, 2-3 wolves, rule out those you know are human and those who are known as wolves.&nbsp; at least 1 seer or enig is a wolf (almost certainly) leaves 1-2 wolves.&nbsp; I am human (or you are for your own measurments) and rule out 1-2 of the seers and enig as human as well, so we are down to 5 players with 1-2 wolves<br /><br />AJ is 20-40% wolf.<br /><br />I will lean towards 25-50% wolf in this scenario myself, though I doubt that there are 2 wolves among those remaining (ie I think enig and either eep or that_kid account for 2 if there are 3 wolves)

				Man, I say I&#039;m ok with having you guys lynch me on day 1 when I&#039;m not being active, but now that I&#039;m actually starting to play I come under fire. What&#039;s up with that? I can&#039;t argue with your logic though (except that it is possible for a wolf to have been voting for another wolf on day 1, and that is why guy made his post about not voting for partners). I just don&#039;t believe that I would be the best lynch right now. You don&#039;t know I&#039;m human, but with me knowing I&#039;m human. It makes more sense to kill an inactive human (to me a very potential wolf) than an active one, especially with ribos&#039;s feigning some semblance of activity. He&#039;s being able to fly right under everyone except apparently me and eep. Everyone else is just willing to allow him the benefit of the doubt, and that is way more dangerous right now. Hitting me today will leave you with 2 humans in the grave from lynches, and then the whole seer debacle will go down. At which point do you return to look at inactives? You&#039;ll have a full line-up of lynches for probably the next 2 days where an &quot;inactive&quot; wolf can just stand back and wait while his partner plays the game as one of the specials. Now is a much better time to kill an inactive, because it stops that condition and in turn allows an active player to continue in discussion and possibly make a mistake. At least at that point you will have more information to go off of other than, &quot;they&#039;re inactive.&quot;<br /><br />Also, if you want to base it on who voted for Haplo, why not look more closely at Dr. Agon and Iron. Is there a reason neither one of them is really coming under fire? Dr. Agon&#039;s main reason for voting for me right now was because of something Iron had done a couple of pages earlier. Why turn a blind eye to that, then call me out for it?

				Iron didn&#039;t name names if I remember correctly.&nbsp; you were attempting to provide EVERY detail of the situation.&nbsp; and if you want to get into the votes, I tried to change my vote of haplo (WAY too late admittedly) to death butt.&nbsp; clearly that would have been a worse lynch given what we now know, but I recognized haplo&#039;s likely humanism, just too late.<br /><br />that post you just made came off as rather frantic and defensive, like you know you have been caught as a wolf, or you think the humans have already lost.&nbsp; I personally am not worried about the future of the seer debacle, as I am confident we will figure this out for day 3.<br /><br />and to finish, Ribos is not off my radar, but I do not like lynching inactives even early and in this case especially early.<br /><br />to close my arguments now, if you have a role come out with it now and I may reconsider, but you still seem like the best lynch for today

				I did say that I typically view inactives as mostly human IF they haven&#039;t been online. I then went on to explain how ribos&#039;s &quot;check-ins&quot; were my cause for alarm and that was what prompted me to vote for him. I also explained why at this point in the game it is better to vote for an inactive. This game has a very interesting situation with the special roles, and that will most likely tie up the lynches for the next 2 days allowing an inactive to slide by.<br /><br />No, I don&#039;t have a role to claim, but it would be insane for me to have a claim. Everyone (active) aside from me has come out with some role (either explicitly or implied), you can&#039;t expect everyone to have a power. I mean, I&#039;m Kyle Craig, but lets face it. I&#039;m a normal human (in real life and in game). <br /><br />Also, I mean... analyzing my previous games you can probably see that I play wolf and human pretty much the exact same. I DO help out when I&#039;m a wolf because it is easier to stay alive that way, but that doesn&#039;t mean that I don&#039;t help out when I&#039;m a human. I&#039;m sure pretty much everyone does the same unless they are trying to play the inactive angle. <br /><br />As far as mentioning who to view goes, if anyone would have followed iron&#039;s plan a name would have had to be decided on anyway. With enigmatic coming out I just figured that would be the best view so I added it to iron&#039;s plan. Clearly no one is following it, and that is how it should be. I was just trying to come up with a useful way to determine this whole role mess.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really panicking because if I die, all it does it potentially allow the wolves to slide through the next couple of days unnoticed, and I&#039;m not a special role so no harm there. I just don&#039;t think it is the best move for human&#039;s to make right now on the especially shaky evidence that can be applied to other players in this game. Ribos is much more solid lynch than am, even if just for the fact that you&#039;re getting rid of an inactive human instead of an active human.

				As for That_Kid, since he isn&#039;t so quick to pull out dr.agon&#039;s role, I personally think that lows the likelihood that either are wolves, unless this is some sort of set up.

Additionally, since we started out with a total of 11 and are now down to 7, we either lynch a wolf or we lose pretty much given balance unless we got lucky. Since I&#039;m not so quick to think we got lucky, we really need to be slow on who we target and vote out which isn&#039;t too unlike how this game has played out.<br /><br />As it stands, I&#039;m leaning Dieter but I&#039;m not ready to legitimately vote for it because that&#039;s insanely dumb (even if we have multiple votes - don&#039;t god damned waste them.) Primary reasons are: rushing votes, really quick to be accusatory. I understand that I&#039;m a target, but I&#039;ve been fairly transparent (albeit sort of quiet) about everything, though one could speculate which is fair.<br /><br />

				Iron, you seem to be missing that fact that if Dr. Agon and that_kid are both wolf partners, it doesn&#039;t mean that that_kid has any powers at all. All he&#039;s told us is that his first view (the night kill) was human. We all already knew that information and gained nothing. He uses his claim to lure out the real seer on D2, then offs the real seer N2. D3 he says he views his partner as having a role. If everyone believes him, then viola, we have a pair of &quot;specials&quot; relatively safe. That_kid, has yet to do anything that would prove him as a seer.<br /><br />As far as enigmatic goes, his ability is weaker than a guardian or a priest because he has to pick. Assuming 1 seer and 1 flava flav, we&#039;re probably looking at just 2 wolves. I mean, if you really think that we have 2 seers, a flava flav, and whatever that_kid is about to say dr. agon is, plus whatever dieter hinted at a couple of pages ago, this game is way beyond unbalanced even if there are 3 wolves. <br /><br />TL;DR: TOO MANY SPECIAL CLAIMS. SOMETHING FUNKY IS GOIN DOWN.

				it&#039;s not unbalanced if one of those seers is a sorcerer, or if flava flav is a bad guy or a third party.<br /><br />also, enigmatic says he has those two powers, but who&#039;s to say there aren&#039;t more that he hasn&#039;t revealed yet? the way that game worked, he got a new power at random each night. what&#039;s next, vigilante? and anyway, i don&#039;t think it&#039;s weaker than either individual role. at the very minimum, he is either solely guardian or solely priest. now, he gains the flexibility to pick whichever one he wants. that is better than simple guardian or simple priest - he can be whichever one he wants.<br /><br />that_kid, you can at least say dr. agon&#039;s role, since it&#039;s unlinked to any potential powers he might have.

				I believe that_kid is a seer or sorcerer as I believe it would have been easy to guess, but the wording was specific enough as well to prove to me it was a legit view.&nbsp; I do not believe enig although it seems semi-likely that guy would be making him like flava-flav because of how much he loved it and he has been sort of using past roles and linking the powers more than we would initially think.<br /><br />2. dieter - 50% wolf (he semi-hinted at something with a very strange post and has been active in discussion, but not super helpful.&nbsp; still he follows his instincs which I generally have agreed with so far (although that happens game after game after game for me and he).&nbsp; <br /><br />3. iron - 55% wolf (he just isn&#039;t able to play the way he usually does so I&#039;m not getting a strong read on him, still process of elimination makes him fairly likely<br /><br />4. liquidangel - 70% wolf (seemed panicked yesterday after I tried to put pressure on him.&nbsp; eep tried to save him by lynching Ribos instead which I considered wolfy day 2 but with eeps night kill it changes everything.&nbsp; as I&#039;m writing this I&#039;m beginning to believe he is actually human just because the push to save him was WAY too weak.&nbsp; I think 5 players didn&#039;t even vote including that_kid and ribos.&nbsp; but I still feel like we need to pressure him more.&nbsp; do you have a power?<br />&nbsp;<br />5. that_kid - 20% wolf (he is a seer or a sorcerer, I am fairly certain he isn&#039;t a sorcerer or he would have given us more info day 2 and not viewed the night kill.<br /><br />6. dr.agon - 0% wolf (me mason)<br /><br />8. aj - 50% (I&#039;m glad he has internet now and I am waiting to hear more from him.&nbsp; still with two wolves and ruling out 2 other players (mason partner and that_kid) we can assume 2/4 or 50 % chance he is a wolf)<br /><br />9. enig.matic - 80% bad guy (he seems like way too much stuff and I thought his claim day 2 was at the time unneccessary and an attempt to disregard the possibility of 2 human seers.&nbsp; he could also be a third party once again and just too powerful.<br /><br />in summary, I don&#039;t like Enig, Liquid, and Iron the most in that order.&nbsp; I am beginning to see the possibility of (this being a guy game) such crazy shit as that_kid and eep as dueling pack sorcs and enig as 3rd party.&nbsp; I doubt the truth, but its something I am watching for now (although I don&#039;t know how)<br /><br />I find that eep may have actually not been a seer and simply didn&#039;t believe that_kid at first and wanted to force lynch him and saw her life as expendible for that reason.&nbsp; (can&#039;t remember if I said this already)<br /><br />finally, I want to encourage anyone left who has a power to come out with it (Iron, Liquid and Dieter I&#039;m looking at you).&nbsp; we have enough information and should be able to develop a good plan of action from here.

				I take it the dark wolf is dead? Otherwise I would have assumed you to include him in your analysis of sorts. If it was ribos then it makes complete sense why you tried to lynch me over him yesterday. I already stated that I don&#039;t have a power. It would be ludacris if that were the case.<br /><br />I still really hard don&#039;t believe that_kid and dr. agon though. One is a &quot;seer&quot; with no true vision and the other is a mason without a named (dead?) partner? I definitely believe the enig play more than that. I mean seriously, the enig power sounds much more like a guy style game than seer + sorcerer+ masons. Also, if your partner is dead, why didn&#039;t you try to help them more? I just don&#039;t quite get your claim unless you&#039;re bluffing with your stats and one of the people on the list is actually your partner. In which case I would guess Dieter or AJ because you put them at 50%.

				to clear things up<br /><br />sorcerer: human with seer powers that is on th side of the wolves<br /><br />does not count as wolf in role checking. so if 5 players remain, two humans, two wolves, and sorcerer, the game is not over. also, if no wolves are alive but sorcerer is still alive, humans win<br /><br />wolves don&#039;t know sorcerer identity and vice versa (unless they view a wolf, but then nothing happens except they know that person is a wolf)<br /><br /><br />wolf seer: wolf that has seer powers. has full communication powers with the wolves<br /><br /><br />also, a seer or sorcerer that happens to be marked has essentially also become a wolf seer

				We leave that_kid alive. It doesn&#039;t make sense for him to really be a wolf seer. He would know who the night kill was gonna be and wouldn&#039;t have viewed him. <br /><br />I still heavily believe that_kid is a sorcerer. I have been weary of his claim from the beginning. He pulled it out too quickly. I believe last night he viewed Dr. Agon as a wolf and is now playing it out as masons. The sorcerer counts as a human for tie breaking purposes, but plays to help the wolves win. So, we shouldn&#039;t kill him ever, but we shouldn&#039;t believe anything he says either.<br /><br />Also, I guess we could sit on this for today if everyone really believes that Enig is lying. I just really don&#039;t like this situation, and all of the claims are fishy. I honestly trust Iron the most right now, but that makes me suspicious of him. lol

				Liquid, I was hardcore trying to lynch that_kid day 2 with eep before eep came out and confused us.&nbsp; if I had this planned out would that have made any sense?&nbsp; maybe just to deflect arguments later on, but by golly, having another seer claim would have been so wildly strange when he also confirmed my supposed bad guy partner was basically confirmed with a seer power by a now nk counterclaim.<br /><br />to suspect me is quite idiotic at this time, but I find it a strange predicament we are in as well, because that_kid viewed me and now knows that I am a mason.&nbsp; he couldn&#039;t lie about the view and call me a bad guy if he were a wolf seer or sorc because he didn&#039;t know if my partner was dead or alive or who it was and I may have had means of proving myself as mason, disproving him.&nbsp; <br /><br />this is why he is neither confirmed good guy or bad guy to me, although I lean towards good as he might still have tried as a bad guy.

				You didn&#039;t know that_kid was a sorcerer. That is the point of a sorcerer. You are a wolf so you try to lynch the seer. Eep comes out and all of a sudden there are multiple seers. One dies. That_kid sees you are a wolf and says you are a mason. This is perfect cover for both a wolf and his partner.&nbsp; Boom, now you know he is a sorcerer and on your side. <br /><br />TO NOT suspect you is the most idiotic thing to do right now. Giving you a free pass is falling straight into a sorcerer trap. I already didn&#039;t like you from yesterday because you were trying to get rid of an active human instead of an inactive one that was a much better choice. After having eep killed and that_kid claim you as a mason, I am even more suspicious of this whole thing. <br /><br />Also, the fact that you are hiding your partner makes it worse.

				I mean, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re the best kill right now (on the slight chance this is true), but you are very high up on my list right now. As iron stated, tomorrow is the real crunch day so I might be ok with you living another day if enig really doesn&#039;t have a more solid defense about anything. I just hate not being able to trust anything anyone says lol. I keep trying to come up with a plan to determine this mess, but I can&#039;t think of a way to actually validate anything.<br /><br />For example, killing you and having enig check your body seems like a plan, but if enig is lying well fuck, and even if your partner requested it, not having the name really leads me to believe that your are trying to hide a wolf partner so the humans don&#039;t know how many wolves are left/ who to kill if you turn out to be a wolf.<br /><br />Also Aj, you really need to catch up or I&#039;m gonna start throwin&#039; some shit at you. As much as I hate all of this special nonsense you seem like a safer lynch at this point. (Although I guess it is getting a little late in the game to be aiming for safer lynches as I&#039;m pretty positive at least two of the three claims right now are bad, and one of them is a wolf.)

				Except that all of that could be done as wolves and you are now trying to play it off as masons. This is specifically WHY sorcerers suck to have in games. I don&#039;t trust any of it. Finally I got you to come out though so we at least know who the other wolf is.<br /><br />Holding back to see who votes for Dr. Agon serves no real purpose. I clearly have incredibly strong reasons for not believing him (and by extension you). The only reason to withhold your identity this long is to see the general consensus of the humans before revealing the pair of wolves to us. Once you believed that you were safe enough for a win you revealed yourself. <br /><br />I mean seriously, how could someone not be suspicious of 2 seers. One of them has to be a sorcerer, and than add a masons play on D3. It is just too damn fishy. Especially because masons are a perfect mask for a pair of wolves.<br /><br />Holding your identity to see who tries to doubt the masons claim is an underhanded tactic aimed to de-credit humans who can see that absolutely NOTHING has been proven here.<br /><br />In short: I&#039;ll be voting for either Dr. Agon or Dieter unless someone else would like to come out with actual proof for this whole scenario. The only people who can at this point are Iron or AJ seeing as enig has already made his choice.

				I guess as a positive, if you are telling the truth you won&#039;t be killed tonight because I&#039;ve probably thrown enough suspicion on you that the wolves (if they aren&#039;t you) won&#039;t want to kill you anyway.

				so let&#039;s pause for a second. we&#039;ve pretty much determined that that_kid has to be either a real seer or a wolf sorcerer, but that he cannot be a wolf seer since he viewed the nightkill (which was corroborated by NKed eep).<br /><br />guy has told us that sorcerers do not count toward the wolf win conditions, so my understanding is that humans can still win the game even with the sorcerer alive?<br /><br />so the punchline here is that it makes no sense to kill that_kid for the rest of the game, correct?

				Correct. I said that a very long time ago. I AM saying that you, Dr. Agon, and that_kid are all bad, but you and Dr. Agon are the ones to kill, and we should just not trust whatever that_kid says.<br /><br />I&#039;m not acting like it is a new revelation. I said I didn&#039;t believe 2 seers from the beginning as well. I&#039;m just reminding everyone else that a sorcerer who views a wolf would try to play it out as masons because that is very clear cover for wolves to hide under.

				The fact that you are trying to state things that I have already stated or already countered makes me believe that you are trying to play ignorant to my accusations hoping the other humans won&#039;t notice.<br /><br />So PLAIN AND SIMPLE VERSION:<br /><br />That_kid = Sorcerer<br /><br />He viewed Dr. Agon last night as a wolf. Then came out today stating that Dr. Agon was a mason so the wolves can win. This provides solid cover for both Dr. Agon and his partner (Dieter). <br /><br />Dr. Agon = Wolf<br /><br />After That_kid claimed he viewed Dr. Agon as a mason. Dr. Agon picked up on the fact that Dr. Agon was a sorcerer and ran with it, but did not reveal his partner immediately because if he were found out to be lying we would get both wolves. <br /><br />Dieter = Wolf<br /><br />After determining that the focus had been shifted enough to enig for today, he came out as the other mason. As a power-play attempt to discredit anyone who was skeptical of his partner&#039;s claim.<br /><br />That is what I believe is going down, and it is a very well played trap. Nothing any of the three of you has done anything to actually prove anything other than Dieter and Dr. Agon can communicate outside of the thread, and that That_kid can indeed view &quot;roles&quot;.<br /><br />So fuck it, might as well vote now. <strong>Dieter</strong>.<br /><br />And honestly, you even said you were wolves. I can&#039;t let something like that mean absolutely nothing to me especially after what Phil pulled a long time ago.

				so you think that 2 wolves + a sorcerer versus a seer + a guardian/priest is balanced in an 11 player game? plus i guess whatever iron is.<br /><br />we need a post from iron because he&#039;s the only other person who hasn&#039;t taken a side in this (besides AJ, who won&#039;t be saying anything at all).<br /><br />also, another open question: does it make any sense for a sorcerer to come out on day 1?

				If we&#039;re running off batty theories (liquid) may I bring up that it was just as likely that eep was the sorcerer? <br /><br />Think about it, if the wolves didn&#039;t know which seer was the sorcerer and the sorcerer didn&#039;t know the identity of the wolves isn&#039;t it likely that the wolves just said screw it and killed one of us knowing that 1.) why do they need a seer? 2.) it makes everyone want to lynch the other seer because it makes them look like they&#039;re a liar. <br /><br />If this is the case, and I know this is gonna sound really crazy and farfetched, but maybe I&#039;m telling the truth and Dr. and Dieter are both really masons.

				I just really don&#039;t like a mason claim. It is too good of cover especially when there is a possibility of you being a sorcerer. Had Dr. Agon just been a human to you I wouldn&#039;t have found it as suspicious. <br /><br />And I&#039;m not saying that eep can&#039;t possibly be the sorcerer I just think it is more likely that she wasn&#039;t. Your claim seemed much more suspicious than hers because it was largely out of desperation, and hers was a counterclaim to yours. You did exactly what I would expect from a sorcerer who was about to die. You didn&#039;t claim seer on D1 on the chance that the actual seer would call you there and you would be dead on day 1. You just held onto the claim. <br /><br />As far as balance goes, was flava flav ever balanced? I mean it is a good metric to go off of earlier, but now that claims are flying everywhere it kind of goes out the window. Also, it kind of comes down to whatever iron is. I don&#039;t believe he is vanilla.<br /><br />My theory is not batty. It just perfectly exposes a trap that I don&#039;t want humans falling into. You can&#039;t go around acting confirmed when for all intents and purposes you aren&#039;t.

You can be setting up a mason claim from the start. That_kid doesn&#039;t need to know you are masons to claim you are masons, that is just good sorcerer play. If I was a sorcerer who saw a wolf I would probably want to say they are masons too. It is fantastic cover for both wolves.<br /><br />DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT CONFIRMED IS? The fact that I can shoot holes like this into everything and you keep re-hashing points that I have countered repeatedly should show you that you are NOT confirmed. I would not even use the word nearly. I would use the word seemingly because that is all it is. It is a trick to make you appear confirmed when really nothing actually proving you circumstances has been shown. If eep hadn&#039;t also said she was a seer I would consider you confirmed, but the fact that that_kid can be a sorcerer makes NONE OF THIS CONFIRMED. The fact that you try to play it off as confirming is what makes me disbelieve it even harder. If you would have simply gone, &quot;you&#039;re right, there is a real possibility that we aren&#039;t who we say we are.&quot; I wouldn&#039;t have found it anywhere nearly as suspicious, but because you keep trying to push how confirmed or nearly confirmed you are it makes me feel like we are going straight into a trap.<br />

				Sorry, all, I&#039;m vanilla. In fact, I&#039;m bacon (formerly a pretzel for reasons I never understood). <br /><br />I think this meshes ok with my &quot;hints&quot; which were basically me narrowing down what I disclaim. I have no powers and only a token role (with no proper noun of a name). <br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s talk about what&#039;s impossible or at least unlikely. <br /><br />It is unlikely that_kid is a sorcerer unless dr agon and dieter somehow converted him. It is impossible that that_kid cannot see roles. <br /><br />It is impossible that dr. agon and dieter cannot talk to each other outside of game. Good job on that, you guys. <br /><br />It is impossible that that_kid is a human while dragon and dieter are wolves (or vice versa). They&#039;re all on the same team. <br /><br />In short, that_kid has a power and is on the same team as dragon and dieter. If that team is wolfy, we don&#039;t have enough claims to balance it, since I&#039;m vanilla/bacon. Enig is clearly not flavaful enough to fight off a team of three wolves, one with a power.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">If we have 3 wolves and four humans, the game ends right now with mislynch.</span><br />2 wolves 5 humans ends tomorrow.<br /><br />We don&#039;t have much to prove enig&#039;s alignment or even power, but we can of course get a good read on his motives. He&#039;s the only claim I would consider lynching.<br /><br />It is impossible that enig is a wolf while dragon-thatkid-dieter are wolves, unless this is an unwinnable joke of a game.<br />It is possible that enig is a wolf while dragon-thatkid-dieter are human. It&#039;s also vaguely possible that all four are human and we have a very strong wolfy presence - and the game ends with mislynch.<br /><br />CLAIMS I BELIEVE<br />Dr. Agon<br />That_kid<br />Dieter<br /><br />VANILLA<br />Iron<br />AJ<br />LiquidAngel - did you explicitly claim vanilla?<br /><br />CLAIMS I AM UNSURE OF<br />Enigmatic<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1. If you think I am human...<br /><br />a. and you think three wolves, one with a power, is balanceable - you should vote for dieter (or another of that triad). This way it&#039;s 2 wolves 4 humans as night falls, 2v3 in the morning, 1v3 as night falls, and we win the next morning. Enig basically has to be right in this case and should do a damn good job - as guardian - to try and give us an extra day to cover any contingencies.<br /><br />b. and you think three wolves, one with a power, is overpowered - you should vote for perhaps liquid (or the other vanillaclaim, AJ) or enig. This vote would indicate you think 2 wolves are fighting 2 seers (and possibly a 1st edition cleric - a guardian/priest). This way it&#039;s 1 or 2 wolves as night falls vs 5 humans, give or take - the game is in the bag for humans if this is the case.<br /><br /><br />2. If you don&#039;t think I am human...<br />...add me to that vanillaclaim list as a possible vote, but nothing else really changes - you&#039;ll just have to challenge the chain of reasoning, thinking I&#039;m trying to trip you up.<br /><br />I. If you vote like scenario B and scenario A is true:<br />We lose tonight.<br />II. If you vote like scenario A is true, but B turns out to be true...<br />a. and there are three wolves living:<br />We lose tonight unless enig is human and guards successfully.<br />b. and there are two wolves living:<br />It is 3 humans v 2 wolves the next day, etc. We should probably use enig as a priest to try and pin down the wolves.<br /><br />This means that even though I happen to favor scenario B, I am very very tempted to vote scenario A (for a triad member). If we vote for anyone other than enig, we need to work really hard to utilize him fully - so I think most of today&#039;s talk should be about making plans which make it worth saving enig (if there are any.)<br /><br />Note that in scenario A, you can&#039;t vote for Enig - in scenario B, you have the option to vote for Enig. He&#039;s probably not more dangerous than any other wolf and we&#039;re welcome to go for his partner. The only reason to lynch him today is if he&#039;s the last surviving wolf, no?<br /><br /><br /><br />If there was a mark of any kind, this all goes out the window, but I don&#039;t think we can plan for that contingency unless we have some evidence that it occurred. That&#039;s too much and cannot fit within our logic window. The sorcerer as guy defines it is included here. Thus, I think we should stop thinking about sorcs (but continue thinking about wolf seer). Balancing a mark is hard and I&#039;d have to think about how you could do it.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll try to review this for more possiblities/impossibilities. I will either be voting for AJ (inactive!) or <strong>Dieter</strong> at day&#039;s end unless someone changes my mind. If Dieter is human, that pretty much guarantees we do indeed have the time to find a wolf or two. This feels really weird but I have convinced myself.

My choice of vote is primarily to make sure humans have the greatest chance of surviving the longest, but eventually that will break down and I&#039;d have to lynch more aggressively.<br /><br />The question to me is whether I am confident enough that you three are human to risk it all right now - remember, if you three are wolf we&#039;re probably dead if we don&#039;t kill one with the lynch.

				liquidangel,<br /><br />why would we set ourselves up as masons for the entire game if we didn&#039;t know there was even the possibility for a sorcerer until eep made her own claim on d2?<br /><br />seems like a pretty big gamble on something we didn&#039;t even know existed<br /><br /><br /><br />iron, i don&#039;t understand why you seem to think sorcerer is unlikely/impossible for that_kid. he can&#039;t be a wolf seer. so he&#039;s either human seer or sorcerer.

Yes, you did present &quot;evidence&quot; and I COUNTERED IT EXPLAINING HOW IT DOESN&#039;T CHANGE ANYTHING. Repeating that evidence again doesn&#039;t automatically make it true. It just frustrates me because you keep rehashing old points.<br /><br />Second of all: How would you even tell him that not to come out. WOLVES CAN&#039;T SPEAK TO SORCERERS. You whole argument is wrong, and so far neither you nor Dieter has said anything to actually PROVE SOMETHING. You just keep stating &quot;evidence&quot; which I HAVE COUNTERED or can&#039;t you read. This is why I don&#039;t believe your claim. By continuously stating the same points, you are trying to make it seem like you are in the right when you have NOT SAID ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING.<br /><br />Hopefully the caps lock will get my point across.<br /><br />Also, posts keep happening as I write so....<br /><br />Iron - thank you, you understand the severity of them all being wolves.<br /><br />Dieter - Wolves can act as masons as much as they want. You could have been setting up to claim masons from the beginning even without the knowledge of sorcerer. I mean, how many games do wolves claim a role to &quot;confirm&quot; themselves. A ton. This is no different, you just started ahead of time and now that we are getting down to the end you have the perfect moment to spring the trap in a seemingly concrete way.<br /><br />Also, we&#039;re in for a very interesting night. This game will hinge on what enig does (assuming Dieter dies and enig is telling the truth). He can either go priest and confirm the trio, because lets face it. THAT is real confirmation (not for him, but for Dr. Agon and That_Kid). OR he hopes the wolves target him to prevent that from happening and he successfully guards the nightkill. <br /><br />So... it&#039;s on you buddy. lol<br /><br />FUCK IT. EVEN MORE REPLIES. I&#039;m posting this anyway so sorry if some shit gets messed up.

Also, you can say that now, but a set-up like that could also be used to attempt to communicate to him that you want to be called masons (he just did it on his own volition).

				obviously kyle, there isn&#039;t really any way to truly confirm ourselves here. but it makes you ask the question: what is actually likely to occur here? do you really think that there 3 wolves, one being a sorcerer, when the humans only have a seer and a guardian/priest? seems imbalanced to me.<br /><br />why don&#039;t you consider the possibility at all that eep was the sorcerer and accidentally killed by the wolves? or that maybe ribos was a wolf we lynched by chance, and that now there&#039;s only one left, like AJ, iron, or yourself?<br /><br />back on topic, how could that_kid assume dr. agon wanted to be called mason? there are half a dozen or more roles/things that that_kid could have said about dr. agon. there was no clue that he should have said mason. there is no way for the sorcerer to communicate privately with the wolves. so he&#039;s taking a random shot in the dark in picking something that will work.<br /><br />consider that dr. agon and myself very subtly set ourselves up to make a mason claim, leaving hints here and there. what happens what supposed-wolf-ally-that_kid says that dr. agon is vanilla human? screws up the whole carefully-laid plan. and now you&#039;re trying to claim that he very luckily picked mason and a bunch of relevant details without any communication from us. sure, it&#039;s possible, but likely? no.<br />

				Once again, I&#039;ve covered the whole calling you masons thing. That_kid did what I probably would do as a sorcerer and just called Dr. Agon a mason because it is the best cover for a wolf team. The fact that you had laid out plans to claim mason just made it even stronger. I am still open to the possibility that eep was a sorcerer that was night killed on accident, but that is the more risky belief at this point. Tonight can pretty much confirm you guys if the right things happen, and we get a solid shot at knowing who the wolves really are, but right now it is too risky to let either you or Dr. Agon live on the chance one of you is a wolf. If the other isn&#039;t and you get to be confirmed. Then awesome we now have 2 confirmed humans and can seriously finish off the wolves tomorrow. <br /><br />I still don&#039;t think AJ is truly active enough to really be a wolf and believe that the actual wolves lay somewhere in the claimed specials. Trying to divert attention back to inactives when it is clear that one or more of the specials is probably lying just seems like a tactic to delay human lynch votes again when we have more than enough evidence to make a legitimate lynch today.

I have no powers and only a token role (with no proper noun of a name). <br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s talk about what&#039;s impossible or at least unlikely. <br /><br />It is unlikely that_kid is a sorcerer unless dr agon and dieter somehow converted him. It is impossible that that_kid cannot see roles. <br /><br />It is impossible that dr. agon and dieter cannot talk to each other outside of game. Good job on that, you guys. <br /><br />It is impossible that that_kid is a human while dragon and dieter are wolves (or vice versa). They&#039;re all on the same team. <br /><br />In short, that_kid has a power and is on the same team as dragon and dieter. If that team is wolfy, we don&#039;t have enough claims to balance it, since I&#039;m vanilla/bacon.

He&#039;s the only claim I would consider lynching.<br /><br />It is impossible that enig is a wolf while dragon-thatkid-dieter are wolves, unless this is an unwinnable joke of a game.<br />It is possible that enig is a wolf while dragon-thatkid-dieter are human. It&#039;s also vaguely possible that all four are human and we have a very strong wolfy presence - and the game ends with mislynch.<br /><br />CLAIMS I BELIEVE<br />Dr. Agon<br />That_kid<br />Dieter<br /><br />VANILLA<br />Iron<br />AJ<br />LiquidAngel - did you explicitly claim vanilla?<br /><br />CLAIMS I AM UNSURE OF<br />Enigmatic<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1. If you think I am human...<br /><br />a. and you think three wolves, one with a power, is balanceable - you should vote for dieter (or another of that triad). This way it&#039;s 2 wolves 4 humans as night falls, 2v3 in the morning, 1v3 as night falls, and we win the next morning. Enig basically has to be right in this case and should do a damn good job - as guardian - to try and give us an extra day to cover any contingencies.<br /><br />b. and you think three wolves, one with a power, is overpowered - you should vote for perhaps liquid (or the other vanillaclaim, AJ) or enig. This vote would indicate you think 2 wolves are fighting 2 seers (and possibly a 1st edition cleric - a guardian/priest). This way it&#039;s 1 or 2 wolves as night falls vs 5 humans, give or take - the game is in the bag for humans if this is the case.<br /><br /><br />2. If you don&#039;t think I am human...<br />...add me to that vanillaclaim list as a possible vote, but nothing else really changes - you&#039;ll just have to challenge the chain of reasoning, thinking I&#039;m trying to trip you up.<br /><br />I. If you vote like scenario B and scenario A is true:<br />We lose tonight.<br />II. If you vote like scenario A is true, but B turns out to be true...<br />a. and there are three wolves living:<br />We lose tonight unless enig is human and guards successfully.<br />b. and there are two wolves living:<br />It is 3 humans v 2 wolves the next day, etc. We should probably use enig as a priest to try and pin down the wolves.<br /><br />This means that even though I happen to favor scenario B, I am very very tempted to vote scenario A (for a triad member). If we vote for anyone other than enig, we need to work really hard to utilize him fully - so I think most of today&#039;s talk should be about making plans which make it worth saving enig (if there are any.)<br /><br />Note that in scenario A, you can&#039;t vote for Enig - in scenario B, you have the option to vote for Enig. He&#039;s probably not more dangerous than any other wolf and we&#039;re welcome to go for his partner. The only reason to lynch him today is if he&#039;s the last surviving wolf, no?<br /><br /><br /><br />If there was a mark of any kind, this all goes out the window, but I don&#039;t think we can plan for that contingency unless we have some evidence that it occurred. That&#039;s too much and cannot fit within our logic window. The sorcerer as guy defines it is included here. Thus, I think we should stop thinking about sorcs (but continue thinking about wolf seer). Balancing a mark is hard and I&#039;d have to think about how you could do it.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll try to review this for more possiblities/impossibilities.

				Enig - so basically you&#039;re saying you can choose whether to be priest or guardian, but once you choose one you can&#039;t flip between. i for one have never heard of anything like that, but then, i only play twg here. still, seems a bit fishy to me. i guess his immediate actions tonight will do much to prove his case. <span class="bbc_u">50% wolf.</span><br /><br />Dr.Agon - pretty much assured mason. you were the one who was the &quot;light wolf,&quot; correct? from the flavor of the roles we can infer that the &quot;dark wolf&quot; would in fact be on the side of the wolves, most likely sorcerer, possibly eep. however, have we ruled out that the the good Dr. here actually <em>is</em> the dark wolf? it&#039;s pretty convincing with the whole light/dark thing, but it can also be easily reversed. <span class="bbc_u">60% wolf.</span> (sorry if i screwed up who is what here, this thread is confusing as balls.)<br /><br />LiquidAngel - very hard to tell, really. however, his willingness to secure possible human identities seems genuine, and he shares many of the convictions i do about enig.matic, namely that it&#039;s all on him to prove himself. i&#039;d say <span class="bbc_u">40% wolf.</span><br /><br />Dieter - you certainly know how to play this game, sir. this always causes me to be wary of you. you are all of course justified in your criticisms of my absence, but just because a guy ain&#039;t around don&#039;t mean he&#039;s a baddy. everyone seems to have a stronger case against you than i do, however. <span class="bbc_u">30% wolf</span>.<br /><br />Iron - basically ditto to the dieter (lol). you&#039;re extremely concise in your analysis of any given situation. you also have a predisposition to go a little crazy sometimes, and post very aggressively, with long posts. i am always skeptical of really long posts, but that in and of itself is no reason to suspect you. you claim vanilla human, yet earlier you hinted you may have a role... ignoring the latter half of that statement, the vanilla claim raises issues of mathematical game balance, which seems to be the topic of some derision. i for one cannot math worth half a doubloon (a singloon?), and for my own sake i put you at <span class="bbc_u">50% wolf</span> until i can work it out.<br /><br />that_kid - falls into the whole mason fiasco which i&#039;m still trying to wrap my head around, and so i put you on par with dr.agon. <span class="bbc_u">60% wolf</span><br /><br />Me - vanilla human. <span class="bbc_u">0% wolf.</span><br /><br />having at least arranged my thoughts into some kind of rough percentage of how i feel, i am at first inclined to place my vote on enig. but a hell of a lot hinges on his ability to prove his claim. however, it also likely either that_kid or dr.agon is lying, or both of them. but which one? i have no idea as of this point, in fact i&#039;m not sure if any i just said makes sense at all. but hey, at least give me credit for trying to be a bit more active in the face of overwhelming reasons not to be (not knowing what&#039;s going on/ everybody mad at me T_T).

It isn&#039;t something I usually like to determine my course of action on. Especially when there is a safer route to go, such as the one above. With iron being vanilla, this game would seem slightly leaned towards the wolves but not by a large enough margin that I would think it is suspicious. The humans still have 2 aux roles that may bring in some power. They just happened to be used wrong.

				You should have kept reading further because Dr. Agon explained why it is still a good idea to kill one of those 3. They control the vote tomorrow if one of them isn&#039;t killed today, and since that_kid is most likely a sorcerer and not a wolf seer, it should be either Dieter or Dr. Agon. Since Dieter already had a vote on him I went that route, but either one would work.<br /><br />There isn&#039;t much chance for the game to end today (especially if both of them are wolves), but killing one of them puts us in a better position tomorrow, because hopefully their claim can be verified tonight.

If you don&#039;t think I am human...<br />...add me to that vanillaclaim list as a possible vote, but nothing else really changes - you&#039;ll just have to challenge the chain of reasoning, thinking I&#039;m trying to trip you up.<br /><br />I.

If we vote for anyone other than enig, we need to work really hard to utilize him fully - so I think most of today&#039;s talk should be about making plans which make it worth saving enig (if there are any.)<br /><br />Note that in scenario A, you can&#039;t vote for Enig - in scenario B, you have the option to vote for Enig.

				I am ow writing my paper before my second class and managed to steal some time to escape.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how we would be confirmed one way or the other during the night phase as the bad guys are most likely to avoid us in order to convince everyone to vote the other way to save their own skin just like you are today.<br /><br />enig, did you just say that you can only guard yourself?&nbsp; that leaves the wolves with a few options, you, Iron, and That_kid.<br /><br />I say today is do or die for your scenario liquid, if dieter and I are wolves, then you may as well choose to believe us now or never because the chance for new information is nealy impossible.&nbsp; do you trust that_kid&#039;s view?&nbsp; would you trust enig&#039;s priesthood?<br /><br />the only slight scenario is lynching me or dieter, enig priesting, and if he is a good guy than the bad guys have to kill him to prevent us from being confirmed, if he is a bad guy than he can&#039;t be targeted and he will call us a bad guy.&nbsp; the problem is that you now know that I know this and could try and use it against you.&nbsp; so here is my proposition, enig, don&#039;t tell us which you are going to use, we may as well lynch me or something and then hope the bad guys don&#039;t target you for fear of you guarding yourself so you can confirm me human.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you can&#039;t believe that enig, dieter, that_kid, and me are on the same (bad) team right liquid?<br /><br />I have changed the purpose of this post too often that I am no longer sure what all I have said already and I appologize, but I don&#039;t have time to analyze my proposition for success rate or content as I have to get to class now.<br /><br />discuss.<br /><br />my vote stays because to me the idea of lynching someone besides one of us confirms us in the night as the game won&#039;t end.

If he says you are human tomorrow there is no way we have that many wolves here. I already explained pretty much everything that can happen earlier. And then explained why it is best to kill one of you. There are a ton of things that can confirm you guys one way or another tonight. We just won&#039;t know until we see it. That is why it is safer to kill one of you today.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand what the point of this post was. It pretty much stated everything I had already said. Like 2 pages ago I stated the different ways you can be confirmed and that if enig goes priest and sees you as human you are confirmed. Apparently you really didn&#039;t read my posts before arguing with me.<br /><br />AND it does confirm you in the night, BUT THAT IS TOO LATE. If you are wolves we&#039;re boned. That is what I&#039;m trying to get you to understand. The entire idea is that if you are wolves we get fucked if we leave all 3 of you alive today. There isn&#039;t any &quot;we get confirmed tonight.&quot; You CAN get confirmed tonight, and that would be great, but if we don&#039;t kill one of you we are boned if you are wolves.

				To explain everything I have said over the past couple of pages so there is absolutely no confusion.<br /><br />1. There is a good potential for That_kid, Dr. Agon, and Dieter to be wolves springing an incredibly strong trap.<br />2. If all 3 are left alive today they control the lynch tomorrow. (Unless a guard happens) This is terrible if they are wolves because wolves win the game.<br />3. If we kill one of them today they tonight rests on enig. He has to choose between priest or guardian and hope the wolves don&#039;t choose the perfect counter for what he picks. If he guards correctly, humans have a very strong shot at this game. If he goes priest and doesn&#039;t get killed he can confirm the Masons one way or the other. If he goes priest and gets killed we know he was telling the truth about his power. Not matter what. Also, if any of Dieter, Dr. Agon, or That_kid get killed we can pretty much assume they are human (that_Kid not so much because after this post Dieter and Dr. Agon could choose to NK him to make themselves seem human). Point is we learn something from the night.<br /><br />So, moral of the story is. One of those three should die today to ensure that we get our night phase and a full day tomorrow. If all of them are left alive, the only way we would ensure a full day tomorrow is with a successful guard. The fact that they keep trying to use tricks to avoid this fact, such as &quot;we will get confirmed in the night&quot; (after it is too late and humans already lose) is what makes me disbelieve their claim even harder.<br /><br />Pushing votes on an inactive, and attempting to push the game to ending today are terrible ways to make me believe you are who you say you are. Since I have called you out all of your tactics have been trying to draw the argument away from the fact you aren&#039;t confirmed, or an attempt to make things seem like they aren&#039;t as dire as they are.<br /><br />Moral of the story is: If all of you are left alive and are wolves. Humans lose, and that is not a risk that should be taken when we can sacrifice one of you to potentially confirm your alignment for tomorrow, and get another day of discussion.

				well, it looks as if i at last must make my vote. after carefully considering the mason arguments concerning Dr.Agon and Dieter, and weighing it out,&nbsp; posts just seem to be attempted a little too much misdirection. i am equally skeptical of both, however if i get killed we lose a human for sure, whereas with one of those two we at least have a chance to get a wolf. as such, i lay my vote on <strong>Dieter</strong>.

				We already established that it doesn&#039;t make sense for that_kid to be a wolf, and I&#039;m not saying enig isn&#039;t a wolf. I&#039;m just saying that whatever he does will have an effect on confirm you or not. I don&#039;t see how his being a wolf would immediately cause wolves to win. <br /><br />It is much safer to kill one of you, which I get why you guys won&#039;t do that, but iron should understand the points I am making.<br /><br />3 wolves is WAY less likely than 2 wolves + sorcerer. Also, That_kid is clearly on your side and not a wolf so... I have no idea where you were going with that one. It is just the same misdirection you&#039;ve been trying to do all day.

				Ok, That_kid (sorc) + enig + aj makes absolutly no sense, and is not as dangerous because clearly that_kid is on your side and voting for AJ right now. If he counted as a wolf it would be dangerous, but he counts as a human and is voting with you guys. Making him not dangerous to you. If he was on the wolf side he would be voting for you right now to ensure a win for the wolves.<br /><br />Seriously, all you&#039;re doing is make yourself less believable by trying to throw out theories that make way less sense.

				Okay:<br /><br />Dieter was indeed a wolf, and was of course paired as a mason with Dr.agon<br /><br />However, he fought the good fight - this apparently matters above all else and labels like wolf are sorta useless.<br /><br />This sucks for me because now I&#039;m personally back to square one and not really sure who is left to lynch. This leaves me to believe that Ribos was actually fighting the bad fight, which is good that we lynched him and shit because oh hey day 4.<br /><br />Given the whole ratio thing, since we have 5 left that means at most there are two wolves.

				Well shit, there went that plan. You got me excited for a second when you said he was a wolf. At least we know we can trust Dr. Agon, who probably wants to kill the fuck out of me right now, and that is completely understandable. Uh, I guess in this situation <strong>AJ</strong>? Because that kid is human (maybe sorcerer, but probably not at this point unless he just didn&#039;t want to help the wolves), I&#039;m human, and enig is probably a human so... that leaves AJ to kill.

				Great<br /><br />So I have to choose between you guys. I&#039;m leaning really hard towards AJ because he&#039;s been active enough to make night kills, but inactive enough to not really commit to creating content in this thread (I am aware that I&#039;m calling the kettle black)<br /><br />However, while I initially want to kneejerk trust dr.agon, I feel like matt might have thrown in some sort of weird style of bullshit where one of the masons was a wolf but couldn&#039;t tell them. Additionally, I want to say that the fighting between you and liquid was somewhat staged but...<br /><br />The AJ scenario seems most likely. I did the whole priest thing and yes liquid was a wolf, but that would be really easy of a claim because no shit he was.<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting to hear other people&#039;s thoughts.

				enig, quite frankly i think you are full of shit. i was hoping killing liquid would just end the game, but now i&#039;m left with a &quot;choice.&quot; in fact, i don&#039;t think it&#039;s a choice at all. you gain the ability to choose between guardian and priest, and choose priest only to view an already seer&#039;d wolf? why not choose guardian and protect the seer, who was pretty obviously going to get NK&#039;d? i think it is because you are neither of those things. furthermore, yesterday you made a halfhearted vote for liquid, only to repeal it once he had the majority, bringing it to a coinflip between me and and him. <br /><br />you claim weird multiple roles, don&#039;t use either of them to accomplish anything, then leave a seer&#039;d wolf to a coinflip lynch. <strong>Enig.matic</strong>.

				okay guys, so what the fuck is going on.<br /><br />I know enig and liquid couldn&#039;t have been on the same team because enig could have chosen to lynch aj last night instead of liquid.<br /><br />that_kid was night killed (I assume as he is not one of the survivors), so it basically confirmed that liquid was a wolf as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m not prepared to rule out dueling packs, but at this point we can say that enig is not traditional third party as there was a night kill.&nbsp; so unless he has a vig power that he can use at night that isn&#039;t the case.<br /><br />AJ on the other side is sort of safe to assume as human as well because that was who liquid was trying to lynch.&nbsp; he has been active enough (at least since liquid died) to be a bad guy, but I struggle to suggest he and liquid were on the same team.<br /><br />hang on I found some inconsistancies I want to bring up when I was looking for my defense against me REALLY wanting liquid dead.

				Also nobody apparently likes my reasons for doing things, primarily because they rely on just how a person would react to being accused/paranoid. It&#039;s applicable to me too however, since apparently none of my actions make too much sense. However, AJ hasn&#039;t done a damned thing this whole game and has pretty much floated by. How is it likely that AJ is human?

				Enig, address the inconsistencies I brought up please.<br /><br />also, I see no way that any of the three of us could have been on a team with liquid which means either a mark upon liquids death where fuck who knows who to vote for, or dueling packs, or 3rd party.<br /><br />what I mean is that liquid was 100% willing to lynch aj so they weren&#039;t on the same team

				It&#039;s just the roles you claim are horribly unprovable. A priest whose only view was a seer&#039;d wolf? A guardian who can only guard himself?

				yes enig, that is true.&nbsp; you still haven&#039;t addressed the fact that you earlier claimed not to be able to get any role or power info and claimed to know later that you learned quite a bit about dieter upon his death.&nbsp; maybe that was guy screwing up (doubtful) or maybe it was your interpretation of what you learned about dieter&#039;s alignment.&nbsp; this for me right now is the tie-breaker because I don&#039;t see right now either of you as an obvious choice

				I guess the most fucked up thing is that I created a tie between the two wolves that are left so it was win/win but nobody wants to believe me. Additionally it&#039;s my fault for being a dick but it&#039;s sort of expected when all game everyone thinks you&#039;re a 3rd party and/or a wolf and you&#039;re given an ability set where you can&#039;t prove you are who you are without a seer (aka: I can only view those who got night killed (priest) and I can only guard myself from knight actions (sort of guardian)). To make matters worse, the one person who could vouch for me is dead as of last night, so now I guess I&#039;m really fucked.<br /><br />Being a dick doesn&#039;t help matters much too I guess.<br /><br />tl;dr sorry for being a dick greg/danny/god/godx2 and good game wolves

				I do want to clarify that I have thought REALLY hard on changing my vote to AJ this game.&nbsp; Enig.matic changing his story and not being able to prove his role (unless he guarded successfully or was viewed by a seer) is evidence against him, but balance-wise I don&#039;t see how masons and a seer can be balanced against a sorc and 2 wolves.&nbsp; I&#039;m relatively sure then that enig is not lying and am willing now to stop being butt hurt and <strong>vote for aj</strong><br /><br />I may still change my mind

				really all i can say is that that is the wrong decision. i don&#039;t really have much more to say than what i&#039;ve already said. i leave my vote on enig. he keeps going back and forth, changing his argument every few hours. in fact the last few posts he made were just raging and then apologizing. i feel bad for Dr.Agon though, cause if I were in his position I wouldn&#039;t know what to do either. just do what you think is right man, this has been one of the best games regardless.

				aj is slain<br /><br />humans win<br /><br />i&#039;m a little disappointed that there wasn&#039;t more discussion day 5. all three of you kind of gave up. i don&#039;t know if it would have been different if it had been other people, but i feel like i would have gone through the thread and looked for more information instead of just saying &quot;yeah this is my gut feeling&quot;<br /><br />for example, the most incriminating reason aj was the last wolf, that neither of you seemed to see: <br />because enig.matic was the deciding vote on the lynch day 4, it means that it doesn&#039;t make sense for him to have been a wolf if aj and liquidangel were also wolves. if that had been the case, he could have won the game right there. so,if kc is a wolf, kyle isn&#039;t. if kyle isn&#039;t a wolf, that_kid was sorcerer and lying for someone. but if kyle wasn&#039;t a wolf, and that_kid was lying, the wolves would obviously be aware of this because they know who they are and that kyle isn&#039;t one of them and that_kid wouldn&#039;t have been night killed (because it then would have been wolf, sorcerer, human day 5 and wolves control vote). so because the game would have been won if that_kid were alive and&nbsp; sorcerer, that_kid is not sorcerer and is telling the truth. which means liquidangel was a wolf. which means kc is not a wolf. so aj must be.<br /><br />instead you used no logic or arguing and said yeah probably aj<br /><br /><br />up until day 5 greg was my favorite this game, because of his pms:<br /><br /><br />subject: night 1<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php?action=profile;u=39">Quote from: Dr. Agon on June 12, 2012, 01:00:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">how do I do mason night PMs?&nbsp; I think I want to change to masons with liquidcraig okay?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>when i responded with what and said that&#039;s not what you do, he said he knows and that he figured i would appreciate a pm from him<br /><br />subject: night 4 mason<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: dr.agon</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">hey, now that my partner is dead and I mourned a day I get to pick a new one right?&nbsp; this time I&#039;m for reals.&nbsp; I want enig.<br /><br />PS. if you do that gay ass &quot;when they die they mark someone&quot; thing you did in dueling packs I will murder my own children after speeding the process of creating them.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />but as i said, i was a little disappointed with day 5, so my favorite player was ribos. every post he made made me laugh. i was sad that eep and dr.agon didn&#039;t catch his references. he role played the best<br /><br /><br /><br />so. roles:<br /><br />1. haplo- lynched day 1 (thank god)<br /><strong>vanilla</strong><br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: guy</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You wake up in a hot mess<br /><br />the last thing you remember you were fighting valiantly against chaos and his lackies awhile ago. but how long ago was that?

				could have been ribos, liquidangel and someone else and had all the human roles we want<br /><br />also you eliminated the possibility of one of the seers being wolf seer too easily. death butt being viewed and killed is probably a good reason, but as i think iron pointed out, a wolf seer could choose to view a kill to see what they&#039;re killing. there&#039;s not really any reason not to do this. they learn almost as much as they do from viewing an alive person, but they then additionally have a reason why &quot;i&#039;m obviously not wolf seer&quot;<br /><br />edit: i mean you the people not you aj<br /><br /><br />but yeah i think up until the end this was probably one of the best twgs mysticboards has had. it was close up until the very end and could&#039;ve been anyones game.&nbsp; the likely winners kept switching in my head. i kind of wanted humans to win so i could post a fake &quot;flava flav wins&quot; to piss off dieter lol

				i deduced that that_kid was sorcerer and you were seer, or vice versa. given that sorcerers do not count against the wolf/human count, i would rather get his information, even if it&#039;s misinformation. and if he ended up being the real seer, he&#039;d eventually get NK&#039;d and proven, validating whatever info he gave us.

As soon as I attacked you and Greg, there was NO WAY you should have still thought I was human. My point wasn&#039;t to prove myself human, but to make the other humans disbelieve you. To you and Greg (and even that_kid) it should&#039;ve been obvious I was a wolf, but to everyone else it could&#039;ve gone either way and that was the angle I was playing.<br /><br />Also, killing eep was a huge fuck up. I realized it almost immediately, and then tried to recover (and almost succeeded). I should have killed iron night 2.<br /><br />Yea, I would&#039;ve rather had Greg logic out that AJ was the wolf at the end instead of losing to some bull, but oh well. Still a good game.

				at first i thought the shiba inu thing was the gayest thing i&#039;ve ever seen<br /><br />but on the other hand it very easily could have been a wolf ploy. if dieter and dr.agon can come up with it for the first time as masons, they&#039;re just as likely to come up with it as wolves, and they would probably even think it more effective because of the same reasons you&#039;re giving<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,916.msg35966.html#msg35966">Quote from: Dr. Agon on July 05, 2012, 07:18:36 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">by my reading you started it based off of me correctly stating that we were nearly confirmed as masons<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>this isn&#039;t true either. you were never even close to confirmed until dieter died<br /><br />also dieter and dr.agon, you have to at least admit that both of you misread things multiple times and that didn&#039;t help your case at any point throughout the game<br /><br />i wish more people played like eep and that_kid (except for the part where he is hard on himself for shit he shouldn&#039;t be)

				the point of those moves were to confirm one of us in the case that we were night killed before we claimed.&nbsp; that never happened so it became suspicious.<br /><br />I always misread things, but I am never the only one to do so.

				that&#039;s true<br /><br />well in any case i think, like i said, that it was one of the best games on mysticboards. i had a lot of fun with this one, and i think that while nobody was perfect, everyone played well

				there was no way to predict the phrase that would yield the correct number of results<br /><br />if someone else is able to provide the correct phrase, then they must be able to communicate outside of the game<br /><br />it&#039;s meant to allow a mason to confirm himself if his partner gets nightkilled before they revealed themselves

				i&#039;m not so sure using google results is a good way to do that. for the record, i get 871,000 results. anyone could (if they wanted) come up with a phrase that approximates it. if you&#039;re dead you can&#039;t confirm who it actually is. if you&#039;re both alive, it doesn&#039;t do anything. someone could have jumped on that if they cared to.<br /><br />i don&#039;t think it&#039;s an effective or useful strategy. guy talked to me about it because he was worried / thought it was dumb but i don&#039;t think it does anything at all. not much more than claiming you&#039;re masons with a dead person, anyway.
