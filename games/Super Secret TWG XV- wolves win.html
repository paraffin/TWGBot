				It&#039;s odd how we&#039;re willing to kill someone who may very well be our seer on D1. All Greg has really said is that he may be crazy. If he is crazy we&#039;ll have more evidence for it tomorrow seeing as there is a very high chance of him seeing a &quot;wolf&quot; again. Killing him today is just jumping the gun. If we do have a real seer and a crazy seer and we kill the real one D1 we&#039;re going to have problems. It&#039;s a better idea to listen to him today unless Greg has something better to say.

				how am i wrong<br />me and logan claim seer<br />one of us is lying<br /><br />i say i viewed greg and i did hes a wolf<br /><br />logan said he viewed greg later trying to prove in an argument hes seer and gregs human<br />greg trys to difuse situation and say maybe 2 crazy seers.............. doesn&#039;t even sound likely<br /><br />also greg voted me <br />then logan followed off of nothing <br />and then later says his reasons are because hes seer and gregs a human....... seems sketchy atttt best<br />if he claims seer hes lying<br /><br />gregs a wolf, logans lying which means hes more than likely a wolf

				you never really confirm anything.&nbsp; just between certain people and then you have to know who to trust.&nbsp; right now I am suspecting cole but leaning towards loads of crazy seers.&nbsp; I feel like it would be better without and seers than to just have crazy seers.&nbsp; I do have a proposition though.<br /><br />TO ALL THOSE SEERS OUT THERE. TRY VIEWING YOURSELF MAYBE, IF YOUR INFO DOESN&#039;T MATCH YOUR STARTING INFO, you are CRAZY SEER, IF IT DOES, you RE NOT CONFIRMED BUT CLOSER AT LEAST.<br /><br />on the downside it wastes a day that a seer could be viewing. not so sure about any of this.<br /><br />I was just trying to think of some way to check.

				I missed a lot last night. I&#039;m going to go with what Haplo said and come out. I&#039;m a seer and I saw a wolf last night but it would be retarted for me to say anything because we already have 3 or 4 other seers saying that someone else is seer and I&#039;m pretty sure everyone is going to think I&#039;m a wolf anyway.

				So I can get another backwards view. Also, if what you two have stated is true then either he, or I is a wolf.

				Staticworth is most likely a correct seer or sees everyone as human. He viewed Kyle as human. I think its safe to say that with this many seers, both That_kid and I can&#039;t both be true seers, so Kyle probably isn&#039;t a wolf. <br /><br />If me and That_kid were both wolves it would be stupid to both claim to see the same 2 people.

				<strong>Ben</strong><br /><br />Since I&#039;m not a wolf. It makes sense for him to be one. I&#039;m also pretty positive that Haplo is correct in his assumptions. I think everyone may actually be a seer of some sort. the point of this game is to figure out what kind of seer you are. <br /><br />For instance (yes, I lied, but now seeing that even more fucking seers exist I&#039;m willing to bet we are all seers.). My N1 view was Dr. Agon and I got &quot;wolf&quot;. My N2 was Pboflow/Cole and I got &quot;wolf&quot; again. the person who looks most similar to me is Logan except his views are both human. There may be a possibility of thinking you&#039;re a seer, but you actually only see 1 role no matter who you view. <br /><br />I want to know what Ben says enig and reaper are.

				exactly what liquid said.&nbsp; I have some faith in staticworth because he was very sure that cole (who turned out to be a false seer) was wrong in his view on me.&nbsp; also he was the first one to come out with a counter claim against the seer claim.<br /><br />to sum up Iron is the most likely wolf I think and static is (not the most likely) but most likely human.

				Don&#039;t you find it odd that That_Kid mimiced your views then said he viewed you as a human to confirm him being a real seer. I find it hard to believe that 2 people viewed the exact same person twice in a row. Seeing as I know I&#039;m human. I&#039;m betting that That_Kid is a wolf trying to make a false seer believe he&#039;s real.

				Also, now that I think about it. It&#039;s also fairly odd that Dr. Agon viewed 2 NKs as wolves and one other person as human. That_Kid and Dr. Agon could be playing all of us. For now I&#039;ll <strong>unvote</strong>. It&#039;s odd that a single person&#039;s views could lead us to a kill. Especially in a game like this.

				holy balls I missed that post entirely.

				That kid, for you I should be pretty much confirmed I had the same views as you did and I announced them before you did. I think its fairly logical to say that you should have a strong distrust in Kyle and Reaper. you viewed me as human, which means we&#039;re both human. And then that means that Reaper and Kyle should be wolves. <br /><br />you should switch to reaper. I think its a much safer move.<br /><br />Also Staticworth, you should also switch to reaper in an attempt to save your life.

				I thought about viewing myself. However, it would not have helped <em>me</em>, seeing as I saw only wolf. I would have just thought I was a crazy seer, as I did anyway.

				I figured something was up after my third view. But then I died.<br /><br />Other than that - awesome game. It caused some hair to be torn out but damn. a good TWG game makes you feel like you have a team but you also feel like you&#039;re the only jackoff who knows anything.

				Danny my claim looked quite legit because I wasn&#039;t the last one to say it. And I actually ended up claiming a paranoid role. It was probably what helped save my life. So to them I wasn&#039;t <span class="bbc_u">the other guy with no role</span>; I was <span class="bbc_u">the seer that sees only wolves</span>. Also, Haplo and Logan both said going with instincts too (I&#039;m pretty sure, but basing off memory.)
