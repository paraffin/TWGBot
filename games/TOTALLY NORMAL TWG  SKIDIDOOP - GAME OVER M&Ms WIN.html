				The gang goes to a perfectly normal restaurant for breakfast. And, like perfectly normal people they each order a perfectly normal bowl of skittles for breakfast. Everything is going wonderfully! No drama, no upsets, just everyone getting alo...<br /><br />&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; eep interjected. &quot;Who put M&amp;Ms in my skittles?&quot; She stood up and looked menacingly around the room, one hand on the other, ready to remove the glove and slay the infiltrator. But no one owns up to it.<br /><br />&quot;Alright then,&quot; she growls. &quot;I&#039;ll have to figure out which one of you did this myself. And in the meantime&quot; - she looked down at her breakfast bowl, &quot;I expect you to clean yourselves up before I get back.&quot;<br /><br />All of you skittles shivered. How were you supposed to find the M&amp;Ms, let alone get rid of them? You&#039;ve never seen, heard, or said anything before, let alone destroyed another candy.<br /><br />Nonetheless, you summon up your courage, and prepare to do what you know you must.<br /><br />M&amp;M GUARANTEE - no really i couldn&#039;t even make this up who does that sort of shit?<br />RULES - let&#039;s say 72 hour days and <del>24</del> 48 hour nights because why not. If skittles get rid of all the M&amp;Ms, they win; if M&amp;Ms have a guaranteed path to eliminate the skittles, they win. change votes as many times as you like per day. In the event of a tie, the less active player will be lynched if there is a significant discrepancy (up to the host&#039;s judgment).<br />COLORS: optimized so that players believe they are going blind.<br />DEATH POSTING: <del>Players may make 1 game-relevant post after death, but only the night after they die. All other (post-death-)posts must be game-irrelevant.</del> Players may not post game-relevant information after their death.<br />PRIVATE COMMUNICATION: no player may communicate privately with another player without my express permission.<br /><br />Had a fun idea about making it a bit more non-vanilla, so we&#039;ll stick it in there to see how it works. I mean disregarding the fact that this is actually a rainbow game anyways. To give you a hint, it relates to how the flavor plays out and avoiding any duplicates/made-up skittles.<br /><br />Players:<br />1. penut<br />2. desu butt<br />3. angynarwhal<br /><del>4. d.agon</del><br /><del>5. modi thursday</del><br />6. <del>anim</del> ktern<br /><del>7. myctis</del><br /><del>8. irnob</del><br />9. balex<br /><del>10. deete</del><br />11. treentalic<br /><del>12. ej</del>

				Maybe vanilla humans are the skittle colors in a bag of original skittles: red, green, yellow, purple, orange. And any other colored skittles would be from the other two flavors, the tropical or the wild berry bag of skittles.

				Also what does rainbow game mean? That nobody (or only one person) is vanilla? Or just a Skittle-y reference?<br /><br />And now I want a vanilla skittle I think that would be tasty. I also want to try eating M&amp;M&#039;s and Skittles in the same mouthful now.

				guy penut voiced why you would vote &quot;no lynch&quot;.&nbsp; to vote no lynch does limit the killing abilities of the humans though and gives the wolves a higher percentage of the votes while the humans pile up information from roles.&nbsp; This probably happens anyways so I like the no lynch, although I do understand that it creates too much pressure on the roles and makes it more difficult to find the wolves using intuition, so I am glad some people are voting for people.&nbsp; I do not understand why deathbutt would have asked for roles to come out though.

Maybe talking about who is suspicious to you is a good alternative to voting for a death. Just like in real life, you can cross-examine the witness without threatening to kill him. <br /><br /><br />The issues with assuming colors are non-repetitive are manyfold.<br />It assumes the host did a lot of research.<br />It ignores the fact that timing of claim is important. <br />What about vanillas?<br />I also don&#039;t think there are 10 colors of either, so to do that you&#039;d have to have a &quot;rainbow skittle&quot; or something.

				As far as colors/flavors go, it definitely seems like there will be hints encoded in them. I&#039;m not sure how easy they will be to interpret though. I guess mine makes some degree of sense, but takes at least a little leap to get to it.

				i don&#039;t think the colors are anything super important, but i can think of one case where it might benefit humans to not all blurt out what color they are.<br /><br />e.g. one-way masons (i think lovers can be one-way too) where say the yellow skittle knows that the green skittle is a green skittle, but the green skittle knows nothing about the yellow skittle. hmm, i guess this would be more akin to a spy?<br /><br />or also to help verify a seer claim, but i&#039;m not sure it&#039;s helped much with that in the past (i can&#039;t seem to recall any seer claims at the moment).

				Just to be sure there&#039;s no mixup me and penguy claimed colors before Mystic&#039; scolor claim appeared. I agree that we shouldn&#039;t all do that now though, particularly for thereasons outlined by Modi Thursday and diet car.<br /><br />My claim wasn&#039;t the greatest idea in hindsight, as there were other ways of figuring out that there are non-standard Skittles in play.

AJ - 40% human - lurking as usual<br /><br /><br />i think right now i&#039;m going to look at the later people to jump on the &quot;no lynch&quot; bandwagon. that&#039;s definitely something i did in the last game where no votes were allowed (coincidentally, i was a wolf).<br /><br />they were, in this order:<br />1. dr. agon<br />2. dietcar<br />3. trientalis<br />4. mystic<br />5. valex<br />6. anime<br />7. AJ<br />8. penut<br />9. iron<br />10. valex (again...?)<br />11. deathbutt<br />12. modi<br /><br />i&#039;m not sure what to make of valex voting twice for &quot;no lynch&quot;<br /><br />it&#039;s not a great reason but i&#039;m just going to vote for <strong>AJ</strong> for always lurking and never doing anything every single game

				Iron - since you haven&#039;t identified that person and their alignment, what is it that is stopping you?<br /><br />Dietcar - I don&#039;t think your deathbutt analysis is even close to reasonable, and I find it suspicious that you would postulate it at all. It appears to me that color information is fairly trivial, and therefore I can imagine Eep flippantly including that sort of thing in any random person&#039;s PM. If deathbutt DID know Mystic&#039;s color, I wouldn&#039;t assign much meaning to it. If anything I&#039;d consider it more likely that the wolves know each other&#039;s colors: a PM might naturally read &quot;Your partner in crime is Mystic the Purple Starburst.&quot;

				A color doesn&#039;t give anything away about role or alignment. It&#039;s a piece of arbitrary information. Knowledge of it <em>implies</em> fraternity but <em>proves</em> nothing. We should stop worrying about color so much. I buy that deathbutt knows Mystic&#039;s color but that doesn&#039;t tell me anything about either of them.

I do think there is at least something suspicious in the (mostly) Dietcar, Iron, Valex color thing, but I&#039;m not sure what to think yet. Theoretically, Iron and Valex could be wolves, in which case Deitcar&#039;s lucky guess is odd, but probably not incriminating. Iron originally claimed to know only alignment, but also didn&#039;t seem too sure on what his role was (i.e. didn&#039;t look it up?)<br />

It actually seems pretty accurate on this run-through (I&#039;m not sure what the red part of the original breadcrumb was for, though - because Death Butt knew Mystic&#039;s color specifically, mebbe?), since one-way masons seem pretty prevalent (Iron, Death Butt, Dieter?) Dieter might not be a spy-thing; he could have just had the idea. But I think it&#039;s FAIRLY likely that Death Butt and Iron are humans. Not sure about Dieter, and I&#039;m honestly still slightly iffy about the rest.<br /><br />I may be missing something: Iron, why did you feel you had to come out with your data. There seems no good reason for Dieter to know who&#039;s data you know; you could have easily considered it a lucky guess and waited until the info was needed later.

There could very well be multiple spies.<br /><br />I&#039;m not overly suspicious of Death butt right now; he came out with spy first, breadcrumbed it (if rather oddly), and has some flavor to help back it up. This also leads me to trust Dr. Agon at least a bit, because he may have a related power, and definitely has some sort of relationship. Doesn&#039;t automagically clear him though.<br /><br />AngryNarwhal seems pretty neutral to me. Dieter seems super odd, maybe, but I&#039;m inclined to put at least a little faith in him while still trusting Death butt.<br /><br />The one that seems the wolfiest is actually <strong>Iron</strong>, but I would like to make sure that a.) that&#039;s not just me distrusting him in contrast to Death butt, who I think is human and b.) that I&#039;m not just developing theoretical ways in which Iron COULD be a wolf. I&#039;ll go gather some more infos in the meantime and come back.

				Let&#039;s try this puzzle.<br /><br />Death Butt claims to know Mystic&#039;s color (purple) and has evidence that he knew this before last night. Death butt is Mystic&#039;s father, which is decent supporting flavor.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg41849.html#msg41849">Quote from: death butt on January 22, 2013, 09:58:49 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There is nothing that says a &#039;spy&#039; (I&#039;m actually Mystic&#039;s father, not a spy, according to the flavor) can&#039;t be chocolate, though it seems to me rather pointless to tell a wolf someone&#039;s color, given they already know alignment.<br /><br />My coming out as one didn&#039;t do much, but there wasn&#039;t much point in keeping it secret after Mystic died. The reason I went to the trouble of breadcrumbing it at all was so that if it did become important for me to reveal this information, I could prove that I knew it in the first day, before I could have used any night abilities. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dieter is not claiming to be a spy. I personally don&#039;t find his analysis to be as incriminating as every else does. Actual color may not be useful (though may give hints - Mystic&#039;s potential purple could be relating to some metaphor or symbolism, like royalty, but guessing that kind of thing would be difficult), but mostly it&#039;s gonna be knowledge of color that helps.<br /><br />In post 140, Dr. Agon wants to hear info from the aux roles. Could be rolefishing, but he supposedly has more info. Votes dietcar, then later says to wait for dietcar&#039;s information.<br /><br />AngryNarwhal doesn&#039;t like Dietcar clearing Death Butt right away. That I can understand, though the Dietcar&#039;s reasons aren&#039;t necessarily malevolent.<br /><br />Iron is a spy on Valex, according to himself. Could also be a wolf or a sorc in much the same way as Death Butt/Mystic. I understand Iron&#039;s reasoning about coming out with Valex&#039;s info, but I still think he could have waited. Would have been a gamble, but could have come out at a more useful time. Then again, I don&#039;t know when that would be. <br /><br /><hr /><hr /><br />So here&#039;s my analysis, looking at these people as best I can:<br /><br />Death Butt and Iron both claim to be spies. There&#039;s no reason we can&#039;t have two spies. There&#039;s to spy/spied pairs at the moment: Death Butt/Mystic and Iron/Valex. The former seems more human (but by no means 100%) since Mystic got NK&#039;d. Which might suggest an Iron/Valex wolf pair (which was the theory that my brain really liked, even though there&#039;s nothing really against either of them except the presence of Death Butt).<br /><br />Lots of people don&#039;t like Dietcar, but I see nothing super-strong against him. AngryNarwhal seems to be operating on hunches and feelings. I don&#039;t really know what to think about the whole situation.<br /><br />Death Butt&#039;s claim of purple for Mystic and Mystic&#039;s claim of not being purchasable conflict a bit. A fringe theory might be some odd breadcrumb like the purple=royalty idea, wherein you can&#039;t buy royalty. But I don&#039;t believe that.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s a bunch of other people. At least one of them is probably chocolate. Peanut, anime, trientalis, and aj weren&#039;t mentioned at all in the above. I don&#039;t have a whole lot of info on any of them yet. I could maybe have a hunch, but I&#039;d never be able to cite any evidence.<br /><br />If Iron is a wolf, Valex probably is too. Though spy could be a wolf role, which would mean most of the information we have isn&#039;t all that useful. Ignoring that possibility (and, to a certain extent, including it), I actually want to go back to voting <strong>Iron</strong> though I&#039;m probably something like 60% confident. <br /><br />One more thing, and possibly further evidence for the theory:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg41672.html#msg41672">Quote from: epplant on January 16, 2013, 01:35:24 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Had a fun idea about making it a bit more non-vanilla, so we&#039;ll stick it in there to see how it works.

				I seemed to remember you voting for Iron when he came out as spy because you didn&#039;t like that his timing.&nbsp; after re-reading I see that you never did, but you did have a bit of a back and forth that my mind recalled as attacking as well.<br /><br />should I say something about how deathbutt&#039;s claim isn&#039;t as credible because it would have been easier to guess mystic&#039;s color (he hinted at it) while valex never hinted at his color being purple.&nbsp; This is a moot point because I refuse to vote for either and encourage everyone else to do the same, but I believe Iron more than I believe Deathbutt.&nbsp; Deathbutt also strikes me as the more wolfy spy claim than Iron does, although thats more based on gut feeling than anything else I guess.

				I&#039;m a yellow skittle and also a yellow-bellied coward. I am also a parent of another player (not saying who). They don&#039;t know it. You can see why I am extremely confused. Deathbutt father flavor checks out (first to say it and there&#039;s no way to make it up). Iron also claimed to be spy and his flavor is also okay, although he could have conceivably guessed at it. Now AngryNarwhal is almost the exact same role as me, except now he&#039;s a full-on mason with Trientalis. <br /><br />So, how do we figure out this mess? I don&#039;t know. Any or none of us could be wolves depending on the rest of the players. One route involves using angrynarwhal or myself to sacrifice ourselves to check if someone is a wolf. But I feel like it&#039;s too easy to blow it.

				okay guys here&#039;s the story<br /><br />penut apparently tried to match me with angrynarwhaal and turn us into masons, but apparently it failed, because i became masons with dr. agon and my child. so we can PM each other (until told otherwise, which makes sense with what mystic has said). i wasn&#039;t sure if we could trust everybody in our &quot;family&quot;. now it&#039;s clear that you cannot.<br /><br />so, dr. agon fucked up either because he thought my child and i were wolves (not sure how??) or he accidentally PM&#039;d both of us instead of his real wolf teammates. <br /><br />what dr. agon said is that he is a sorcerer who is &quot;already wolf&quot; and can submit a nightkill vote. he only gets alignment with his views, so it appears he was searching for his wolf teammates. N1 he viewed iron and found out he was definitely skiddly. he said he was going to view trientalis tonight. he then said he was locked on narwhal (??), but that [angrynarwhal] posted his shit. <br /><br />but either way, dr. agon thinks narwhal is a wolf and wanted to discover him so that they can communicate, presumably. i think he also attempted to kill valex because he thinks valex is the most confirmed human. he&#039;s the green m&amp;m and he has no other flavor.<br /><br />shortly after dr. agon then sent another, shorter PM where he pretended instead to be the seer. i have not communicated with him since.

				I can confirm that I am the child of Dietcar. I was initially given no flavor regarding family, but&nbsp; N2 was allowed to begin speaking privately with Dietcar and Dr. Agon. Dr. Agon then (accidentally) sent a PM stating that he was a sorc that started out as a wolf and that he could submit night kill votes. This is a possible explanation for why there was no kill last night - the NK votes were tied, since Dr. Agon apparently does not know all of the wolves (otherwise, why would he need to be a seer that only received alignment info). <br /><br />I had wished to stay undercover as long as possible, since if both me and Dietcar are killed then all the information that we had about Dr. Agon is gone.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg42129.html#msg42129">Quote from: Dr. Agon on January 27, 2013, 11:38:17 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">alright, so I&#039;m attempting to come up with the best way to explain myself.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; I am a skittle<br /><br />2.&nbsp; I am a seer and did view Iron night 1 as a skittle.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Night 2 was viewing Dietcar and was then told that I could now communicate privately with <strong>Dietcar</strong> and Modi Thorsdday,<br /><br />4.&nbsp; it seemed natural to me at the time that I was a sorcerer and was unaware of it, especially since the two of them were talking about having chocolate children and my view of dietcar was that he was definately full of chocolate.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; I fucked the game up by telling them I was a seer and am now obviously their main target and am no longer going to be believed by anyone on the thread and as a seer am now completely useless.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem is that I told them how my mechanic worked and that I get only alignment (skiddly or chocolaty), not color or anything so they have all the information that I have already.&nbsp; in either case dietcar and modi have made a good move off of my mistake, casting infinite doubt onto me while there isn&#039;t much I can do about it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of these, 1 is simply a lie, because a wolf can&#039;t claim to be an M&amp;M. That would just be dumb. 2 is true, and it is also probable that Iron is a skittle, since that information was given in his misfired PM as well. 3 is probably false; in his PM he said that he was currently viewing Narwhal, whom he thought was a wolf, but was considering viewing Trient instead. What doesn&#039;t make sense to me is why he would say Narwhal is a wolf if he himself thought Narwhal was a wolf. Perhaps his view came up negative.<br /><br />4 makes very little sense. I see no reason you would have assumed that you were a sorc, even if your family was chocolaty. This argument could also by anyone to say that if Dietcar is a human then me and Dr. Agon must be as well. This can&#039;t be true - someone in this family is an M&amp;M. If it was both me and Dietcar, then it would never have been intelligent to start this whole thing. Also, what does it mean for us to be talking about having chocolate children? Did we both have children? As far as I have seen, one person has a child and the rest are clueless about it. I am Dietcar&#039;s child and have no knowledge of children. Dietcar has only me, as far as I know.<br /><br />As for the rest of Dr. Agon&#039;s post, there doesn&#039;t seem to be all that much doubt on Dr. Agon for whatever reason, and there&#039;s certainly a ton of doubt against me and Dietcar. It would actually be a pretty clever move to bring doubt on Dietcar, because there was already a lot on him, and that brings doubt onto me by proxy.

				There is a lot of evidence against Dr.agon. What is confusing and bothering me right now is that Modi seems to know so little about Dieter&#039;s power. The only explanation I can think of for that, since they so clearly are indeed masons, is that Dieter doesn&#039;t have this power after all. It&#039;s a good claim for a sorc / wolf-aligned human. <br /><br />That being said, the holes in Dr.s&#039; story seem to be growing the more we examine it.

				I believe that Dieter is a yellow-bellied coward, but that doesn&#039;t provide any evidence for his skiddlyness. There might be different coward powers for different coward alignments; he could hide behind a human so that views on him etc are redirected to that human, for example. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s revealed any details of his coward power either, beyond saying it&#039;s like nawa&#039;s. Has narwhal even said enough for Dieter to know that? His spy breadcrumb also doesn&#039;t prove anything; as we said before there&#039;s nothing that says a spy can&#039;t be chocolate.<br /><br />His sacrifice power is also a bit sketchy and I could imagine eep including a role where a wolf could sacrifice himself to mark someone (perhaps a &#039;sorcerer&#039;? I&#039;m not really clear on exactly what this term means.) or some other &#039;worth it&#039; thing. I doubt he&#039;d say he could kill himself if he couldn&#039;t arrange for that to happen, unless he had some really good excuse for it failing. Point is, we&#039;d never be able to trust his view unless some other evidence arose that proved him innocent. Besides, even if he&#039;s telling the truth, there&#039;s still a good chance he will just view Dr Agon and learn nothing.<br /><br />What he&#039;s claimed so far doesn&#039;t seem <em>too</em> OP, the Mason thing seems like it was the consequence of a Joiner or something, given it seems like they were all put in touch at the same time.<br /><br />Dr Agon says he knows who joined him to Dieter and Modi, Dieter doesn&#039;t seem to know and think&#039;s it was penut&#039;s failed attempt. It&#039;s also weird to me how Dieter seemed to assume he knew that penut was responsible, by saying that he could vouch for penut when his power failed, and is now having to sort of back off of that.<br /><br />Dr Agon, can you explain why you know and Dieter and Modi don&#039;t?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg42153.html#msg42153">Quote from: Modi Thursday on January 28, 2013, 10:29:38 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4 makes very little sense.

Also, what does it mean for us to be talking about having chocolate children? Did we both have children? As far as I have seen, one person has a child and the rest are clueless about it.

If his role is exactly the same as Dietcar&#039;s, it doesn&#039;t make much sense - he would die if he hid behind a teammate, and that seems odd. If that&#039;s not actually his role, then where&#039;d he get the information - it certainly seemed to me that he knew about the hide-behind-an-M&amp;M clause. He might have started with knowledge of that role&#039;s flavor or something, though. Or maybe he&#039;s just a skittle that happens to be the same as another skittle - eep may have chosen roles by picking skittles out of a bag, in which case duplicates is possible (though again, descriptions in the first post suggest that there may be a special rule regarding duplicates).

				We can all stop hypothesizing that Dieter and I have different powers. His is radically different. They have the same name, according to him. <br /><br />I will do this a third? time so that perhaps you can manage to comprehend this time. <br /><br />I choose one (1) person to hide behind each night. Any powers that are targeted at the person I am hiding behind are also, additionally, conjointly, likewise, targeted at me. No powers targeted directly at me will have any affect. In NO WAY can I affect the person I am hiding behind REGARDLESS OF THEIR ALIGNMENT. They will not even know it happened. At the end of the night, I learn ONE THING and one thing only: whether or not I have died. I gain no other information whatsoever. <br />I cannot affect the person I am hiding behind in any way. I cannot kill a wolf. I cannot kill a human. I cannot view alignment. I cannot create mason pairs. I cannot bake a souffle. <br /><br />Dieter, why don&#039;t you go ahead and make your own role just as clear. Even though everything above was stated quite clearly the first time I revealed, when you did yours, all you said was &quot;We have the same power&quot; and then later, as if you had somehow missed that part in my explanation, &quot;oh lul jk actually I can kill people.&quot; Obviously there is some confusion here, and I don&#039;t actually remember you ever making any full claims except riding off my own. Which is starting to make less and less sense considering how poorly you understand it.

				Dieter, it&#039;s ridiculous that your power confirms a human to you each night, in addition to its other uses.

				treat wolf seer (wolf with seer powers) like wolf<br /><br />treat sorc (wolf aligned seer; counts as human) like seer<br /><br />in this game it&#039;s a bit different though because its possible for a sorc to be in contact with the wolves so keeping them alive might be a liability. but in dr.agon&#039;s case the people he was in contact with were against him, so i don&#039;t think it was entirely necessary, especially considering we never knew for sure if he was lying or not. though he could have also been a wolf seer

Him being dead now is potentially convenient for the wolves (assuming, of course, that Dieter is not one of them), since it means that we can&#039;t stand him against the wall anymore.<br /><br />Still, I&#039;m convinced at this point, which means that I think that AJ is highly suspicious.

				Well, I read over this really quickly. I am currently in the middle of the woods.

Probably later tonight. I am just wondering, because I have not had a lot of time to read through this, how are you coming to the conclusion that AJ is a wolf?

				Oh one more thing. I became masons with Iron at the beginning of night 3. He was the one who has matched up most of the people who can talk to one another. He linked me and Narwhal, and modi with dr. agon, and then him and me.&nbsp; So that is why people have randomly been able to talk.&nbsp; Iron was a red skittle, and penut is also claiming red skittle, he says aj is an orange skittle, and iron also said that valex was an orange skittle. I am going to say that <strong>AJ</strong> and penut are most likely both wolves. penut also claims to have a role that is very similar to that of the role that iron has. He was supposed to be able to match people up so that they could talk.

				it would be beneficial for the humans to keep me alive. Dieter&#039;s death doesn&#039;t necessarily indicate I am instantly a wolf, and i assert he was killed by something else other than me, perhaps in a clever (or pretty damn obvious, depending on how you look at it) attempt to frame me. there&#039;s no evidence as to whose death (Iron or Dieters) was the NK. in fact i daresay that if i die, the humans will be bereft of their most powerful weapon - the power to block any effect of one role per night, including NKs, seer views, everything. easily proven, someone do something to someone and i&#039;ll stop it. last night i did it to modi.

Narwhal claimed on D2 that he&#039;d become masons with Trient during N1 and that Trient told him she is pink. This was well before most people knew anything about colors, like if there were duplicates, if they implied anything about role or alignment, etc., so it would only be natural for her to claim a false color as a precaution if she were a wolf paired with a human.<br /><br />

				Looked back through a bunch of the thread. I&#039;d recommend others do so as well, given all the fresh data we&#039;ve got on how things turned out. My thoughts:<br /><br />Iron never revealed what his power was, only saying during N2 that his worked and that it was similar but apparently not identical to penut&#039;s.<br /><br />Iron was declared human by both Dieter and Dr Agon and is thus very likely to have been human.<br /><br />Nobody has taken credit for any of the successful mason pairings, though there are two that we know of. Penut claims his N2 attempt failed and hasn&#039;t mentioned any other pairing. <br /><br />Iron asked a lot of questions about Narwhal&#039;s pairing with Trient and wanted to know how it happened. I think this suggests that this was Iron&#039;s doing. His language suggests that it was a one-shot deal (&quot;mine worked&quot;). As a human, he also would have told us if he paired Dieter et al.<br /><br />Modi confirming Dieter&#039;s (now deleted) PM&#039;s proves that either both Dieter and Modi are wolves or Dr Agon was a wolf. The PM&#039;s could not have been the way they were if Dieter was the only one lying.<br /><br />Having reread, I still think it most likely that Dr Agon was a wolf, for a lot of reasons. This clears Modi and Dieter and directly implicates Penut and AJ.<br /><br />A wolf binder, <strong>Penut</strong> in particular, makes a lot of sense to me. I think Penut marked Dr Agon on N2 and paired him up with Modi (and via hiding, Dieter). I think this was a one-use wolf ability that took the place of the NK. That explains why Dr Agon didn&#039;t seem to fully understand his role, thought he was talking to wolves and everything else that Dieter said he said, such as being &quot;already wolf&quot;. I imagine that Dr Agon was either a normal seer or a sorcerer of some sort beforehand, explaining Narwhal&#039;s spy view.<br /><br />Penut will try to say the evidence isn&#039;t&nbsp; all that clear and whatnot, but I&#039;ve seen literally no evidence that Penut is a skittle and a lot of evidence that Modi is telling the truth. Penut&#039;s just been calling it all &#039;too perfect&#039; and his binding attempt mysteriously didn&#039;t work and fighting all of this stuff with AJ and Dr Agon the whole way. AFAIK nobody else has vouched for him.<br /><br />AJ is the best candidate for the third wolf, for hopefully obvious reasons.<br /><br />ktern, do you lose if you die no matter what?

(this is a long shot, but we do at least figure that a mark happened anyway and this would be a hella good strategy IMO.)<br /><br />i mean i could be totally off with these but i really don&#039;t think we have 3 effective alignment views per night

				Yeah, narwhal could potentially be a wolf. I spent a long time looking at Narwhal but ultimately couldn&#039;t come up with anything beyond his taking a long time to understand and confirm that particular detail of his power.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what that would imply though, or how it would fit into/break my brilliant theory. <br /><br />Also, assuming Dr Agon was just a regular human to start with, we started wtih two seers and two hiders in this scenario, while the wolves have one mark and a roleblocker (plus perhaps a real power from guy). Considering the hiders apparently confirm every person they hide behind as human, that would be really quite ridiculous.<br /><br />So what does that suggest? Multiple factions?

				it&#039;s hard to tell... i&#039;ve got my own thing going on, obviously, but do most other skittles just have a regular victory condition? i&#039;m positive there&#039;s something odd about this setup and while i don&#039;t know what to do about it, i think it&#039;d be careless to take things at face value<br /><br />straight up, i don&#039;t buy that we could have had 2 seers and 2 hiders. with 12 players in the game and enough coordination, EVERYONE could be scanned in 3 nights. even if there were 5 wolves in the game we&#039;d sweep them, and that&#039;s ridiculous. there&#039;s no way the gimmick is just &quot;there are lots of wolves&quot; to compensate for a human team like that<br /><br />in the duelling packs case, i feel like seers are more suspect than the hiders, since numbers matter more to wolfy teams. on the whole hider doesn&#039;t come off as a wolfy role unless there are just a lot of wolves or a hider got marked. maybe 2 originals + 1 mark per pack, duelling packs? that&#039;s a shitton of wolves but duelling packs might even it out. skittles vs m&amp;ms vs reese&#039;s pieces or something<br /><br />all said though i think we can trust modi for now and then reconsider if things start getting strange. if we act fast with penut and AJ we should have time to spare

				hmmm<br /><br />what if narwhal uses his hiding power on modi? if we can confirm modi as human, the next step is a lot more obvious. if narwhal dies, well, shit&#039;s going to get crazy<br /><br />again, i trust the hiders over the seers, since as i&#039;ve said hiding isn&#039;t a very wolfy ability--the &quot;die on hiding behind wolf&quot; clause is either unnecessary or makes the role very unstable (in duelling packs). that&#039;s not a guarantee that they aren&#039;t wolfy, obviously (especially with marking apparently on the table), just that it seems less likely to me<br /><br />there&#039;s the possibility that the wolves simply slipped when penut said he ID&#039;d AJ, although admittedly that does look rather optimistic considering there&#039;s basically no good reason to do that. even if they don&#039;t initially have communication lines open, penut could have silently masonized AJ and nobody would know a damn thing

				okay so i&#039;ve been struggling to read all of these today &gt;.&gt; and i still need sleep. sorry<br /><br /><br />anyway. i don&#039;t understand why modi never viewed dieter. or if he viewed me as a wolf why he waiting this long to tell me or why he ever listened to anything i said? i don&#039;t get it<br /><br />regarding my ability. didn&#039;t i claim before iron specifically said anything? i never even realized he had the same ability as me until trientalis said it. if i were a wolf, why the hell would i kill the other binder instead of someone potentially more dangerous to me? if i recall, iron was helping me, although that could be wrong i can&#039;t remember 100%. also my binds:<br /><br />night 1: me and aj<br />night 2: narwhal and dieter (failed)<br />night 3: trient and iron (failed) &gt;.&gt;<br /><br />i gather night 2 failed because they were both hiding. i did this to prove myself and posted when i sent the pm to link them but before i knew it failed. night 3 there were already so many bonds so i just picked the lovebirds so they could become more acquainted with each other but was then frustrated when it failed. i wish there had been some coordination<br /><br />also for the record, mystic said he disconnected people<br /><br />debronzing <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg42343.html#msg42343">Quote from: death butt on February 03, 2013, 04:35:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A wolf binder, <strong>Penut</strong> in particular, makes a lot of sense to me.

That explains why Dr Agon didn&#039;t seem to fully understand his role, thought he was talking to wolves and everything else that Dieter said he said, such as being &quot;already wolf&quot;.

Especially since I can get a lot more information about him as a mason than I can anyone else.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The increase in reliable information gained is exponentially greater when identifying your mason compared to anyone else.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was able to confirm all of the information that Dietcar gave, or at least all but a very insignificant fraction, and so it seemed highly unlikely to me that he would be an M&amp;M. I also never had the initial distrust of Dietcar that everyone else did, and so it did not occur to me to investigate Dietcar further. Last night I was also basing my opinion off of his hiding behind AJ, and would have received (at least some) positive evidence for him being an M&amp;M if he had not died. That was not a great idea, in retrospect since I should have realized that using my ability on you would not necessarily have given me results, and I would have been able to try to confirm Dietcar. That obviously wouldn&#039;t have worked with AJ&#039;s roleblock, but I would at least have been able to confirm the existence of THAT.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Excuse me if I think it&#039;s rather convenient that you just happen to overlook your partner in favor of incriminating the person he wanted you to, as well as failing to view anyone last night thanks to the reasons he pointed out himself that night.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Convenient? I personally don&#039;t see it as all that convenient. Being able to incriminate penut, maybe, but completely failing to provide information last night was an obvious mistake, no matter what my alignment. However, if I was a wolf, it would certainly be more convenient to, say, confirm Dieter. Instead, I took a gamble and thought I would try to view you, since I was already fairly sure on Dietcar. I forgot to extend hiding to seer-views, and that was dumb, and that mistake certainly has not been convenient.<br /><br />Think about it from my point of view. If I&#039;m a wolf, then I&#039;m trying to spread information and confirm that me and Dieter are humans and Dr. Agon is a wolf. That doesn&#039;t make much sense, though wolves can mess up too and don&#039;t always do the right thing.<br /><br />If I&#039;m a human, then I&#039;m trying to find new wolves and occasionally confirm humans. It&#039;s better to find a wolf than confirm a human in a lot of cases, especially if I&#039;m already pretty sure that someone, like Dieter, is a human. Being masons with him, I had already seen that almost everything he did and said matched up with my goals and was true, though not necessarily perfect logic. So I sought to find the remaining wolves.<br /><br />Humans can make mistakes too, so EITHER WAY, my actions are imperfect. So based on that alone, it looks more like a 50/50 chance from an objective standpoint, but there&#039;s also the other evidence, such as Dieter&#039;s death at the same time as Iron&#039;s, and so on.

				given recent events, my current working theory is that the game is 3 default wolves, 1 mark, 1 sorc. (the following is speculation, i&#039;m too lazy to write &quot;i think&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; alongside everything.) default wolf roles are 1 binder (penut) to establish communication lines, 1 hider (narwhal) to throw off views, 1 blocker (AJ). the sorc was dr.agon, and by shit luck, the wolves also happened to mark him. dr.agon thought that by &quot;upgrading&quot; to full wolf he had been placed in communication with the others, but it was a misunderstanding. (this also would explain his wording, since sorc is kind of a &quot;partial&quot; wolf.)<br /><br />i think we&#039;ve got a lot of arguments as to why penut and AJ are wolfy, so there&#039;s no need to go further there<br /><br />as for narwhal: similar role to dieter, but doesn&#039;t die if he hides behind a wolf? that&#039;s uhh kind of a strictly wolfier version of dieter&#039;s role. &quot;dies if he hides behind a wolf&quot; is completely unnecessary for a wolf version since they presumably wouldn&#039;t suicide that way. plus he&#039;s now pushing for a lynch on modi, and yeah we can&#039;t automatically trust everything modi says, to be sure, but it seems like a really bad idea to straight-up lynch him<br /><br />anyway, let&#039;s assume trient and mystic&#039;s colors are real and that both are human. that means for every color pair there&#039;s an alt alignment person stuck in there. you&#039;ve got red wolf, yellow wolf, orange wolf, green pseudowolf (sorc), and blue 3rd party (survivor). the mark is thrown in the game to disrupt the color-alignment pattern so that the game isn&#039;t just color massclaim followed by &quot;hey let&#039;s view one person from each of the color pairs and lynch accordingly&quot;, and the high (3 wolf + .5 for sorc + 1 mark) wolf count is balanced by removal of communications<br /><br />so if anyone&#039;s like &quot;well k// that is convenient and all but what if there is actually one wolf-aligned in every color pair i.e. you&quot; that is legit. now, considering that we potentially have all the wolves identified and a live seer, i propose that i get viewed immediately. since my priority is survival, i don&#039;t want any suspicions on me, and the wolves shouldn&#039;t have time to NK me because of the amount of danger they&#039;re in<br /><br />further, lemme be selfish for a sec here: if there&#039;s a guardian out there (and given N2 i think there is), i want that guard on modi so i can definitely get that confirm. i know arranging guard targets in advance tends to be silly because it makes wolves hit someone else, but you guys should be able to spare one person and i like to think i am being a valuable contributor<br /><br />how about it, guys

Basically, Dietcar helped me in every way to disperse what I knew, to confirm me, and then he sacrificed himself to find another wolf. It would have to be a quite insane story for him to be a wolf. Yes, a seer view would have confirmed him, but would it actually have been worth it to confirm something that I was almost sure of already? Not for me, though I can certainly see why you guys would want that view to have been made.

				I&#039;m not actually a roleblocker, I&#039;m the guardian. I didn&#039;t want to come out and say it right away because I thought I would immediately get NKed upon coming out so I made myself look like a roleblocker to try to be ~subtle~ but that kind of backfired so fuck it. Sorry for the confusion lol<br /><br />I do think roleblocking and guardianship are pretty similar, because they both &quot;block&quot; things; guardians block NKs, while roleblockers block, well, everything. So my argument against AJ is still valid I think.<br /><br />I&#039;m dead tonight but whatever, I don&#039;t know how much that matters. I&#039;ll guard Modi so he stays alive. I can tell you who I viewed if you guys want

			<dd class="postbody">
				This game was obviously somewhat experimental, and I&#039;m still not quite sure whether it had balance issues or skittles just didn&#039;t play very well. Early in making this game, I realized that there weren&#039;t that many colors of skittles (at least, not traditionally) and I though it would be neat to have a game with lots of spies and the wolves not knowing one another. It&#039;s another one of those slightly tricky situations where, had there been one less wolf, I think the game would have been pretty strongly stacked against wolves, but as was, it was possibly slightly in wolf favor. I imagine, though, that the game might have gone rather differently if more people had taken notice of this, in the first post:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,995.msg41672.html#msg41672">Quote from: epplant on January 16, 2013, 01:35:24 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Had a fun idea about making it a bit more non-vanilla, so we&#039;ll stick it in there to see how it works. I mean disregarding the fact that this is actually a rainbow game anyways. To give you a hint, it relates to how the flavor plays out and <strong>avoiding any duplicates/made-up skittles.</strong></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It took a little while for people to start becoming suspicious of all the duplicates. Nonetheless, this was a sort of fun game to host because, for the first few days, the game was very, very close to swinging to one side or the other, but never quite made it there. And then it fell quite quickly.<br /><br />Colors were actually totally randomized, but attached to roles, although there were a few somewhat funny coincidences (including mystic&#039;s &quot;Tastes like purple&quot;) that I noticed afterwards.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t think that allowing dieter to post the PMs would have quite the effect that it did (especially since it would be different from posting host PMs), but in hindsight that was a poor decision and I probably wouldn&#039;t do it again. Also, I knew that the game would have been over for skittles if dieter was lynched instead of dr.agon, but the opposite was not necessarily true. I had considered notifying players that were entered into communication pairs that they did not inherently know their partner&#039;s alignment, but I decided against it because I didn&#039;t want to influence any wolf plans to trick human players. This seems to have worked out well for Angrynarwhal, but not for Dr.Agon, and I&#039;m not sure whether I would do it differently in a similar situation. Possibly it would be a better idea in the end, though, especially before the connecting mechanism was made clear to disconnected wolves.<br /><br />There were a few player decisions that confused me a bit (for instance, that Iron never connected himself to Valex, despite knowing his alignment). I&#039;m not sure how things would have been different otherwise.<br /><br />Possibly the funniest moment in the game for me was when Valex guarded Dr.Agon after he had been lynched.<br /><br />N3 role changes came about because I realized in retrospect that I basically had not given roles to 3 players. Whoops.<br /><br />The yellow role came from the role &quot;hider&quot; I encountered on a different forum (where it was actually considered &quot;vanilla&quot;). I think it&#039;s a cool role that requires some interesting strategy, especially when played by a human. Potentially very powerful, but with a p big risk.<br /><br />Anyways, yeah. Hope a few careless things didn&#039;t fuck stuff up too much. I might have had other thoughts but I don&#039;t remember what they are offhand. Ah well.

				I only briefly read through the roles, but it didn&#039;t seem to me like the skittles realistically had a chance with a 7-5 player split. Even though the M&amp;Ms started off disconnected/similarly uninformed, once skittles started dying, there just weren&#039;t enough players working in the interest of the skittles to figure things out.<br /><br />That said, I liked the flavor a lot, and it was a well-appreciated effort.

				Hmm, ktern and Narwhal I think I would have guessed due to duplicates if I had realized there were so many wolves, but all my other reads were pretty accurate :p<br /><br />I agree with what Dieter said about balance. It perhaps could have been balanced out with powers, but I think the net result would be chaos or people knowing way too much. That said, it looks like if we&#039;d kept one more human alive the wolves might have screwed themselves over. Perhaps it is just a very volatile setup.<br /><br />Either way it was fun and I liked the flavor (even though it was skittles mixed with M&amp;M&#039;s... gross). I also liked that people weren&#039;t told they might be paired with oppositely aligned powers. I also liked Penut&#039;s restriction (having to PM everyone at once). Trient&#039;s power was pretty cool too.<br /><br />I should call dibs on hosting the game after Trient&#039;s, if that&#039;s all right. I&#039;ve got a fun and elaborate flavor/game idea that I&#039;ll just sit on unless I commit to hosting it.

Even though the M&amp;Ms started off disconnected/similarly uninformed, once skittles started dying, there just weren&#039;t enough players working in the interest of the skittles to figure things out.<br /><br />That said, I liked the flavor a lot, and it was a well-appreciated effort.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>See, I&#039;m not 100% convinced that it WAS such a guaranteed wolf victory under those starting parameters. I didn&#039;t realize that penut/angrynarwhal didn&#039;t feel confident about k// being a wolf, which admittedly could have changed a few things (and possibly ended things in a tie). So possibly I should have just let the game continue out to the end, but even if it hadn&#039;t been, there were a lot of possible ways for things to end. If penut had been lynched instead of AJ, it&#039;s quite likely that k// would have gone along with a &quot;let all of my wolf partners die and then use my vote priority&quot; plan, which would, of course, have ended in Trientalis exploding and taking him with her. Furthermore, while it was really obvious from outside of the game which players were wolves and how many there were, I think a lot of the actual M&amp;Ms felt the risk of connecting, even with someone they THOUGHT were on their team, a lot more keenly.<br /><br />If I were to redo this game, I would probably have the mechanism (wolves do not all know the identity of other wolves) and the bonding role be known publicly, which would allow humans more freedom to manipulate it. Possibly would also get rid of the provision in human hider that kills them when they hide behind a wolf, or added in something similar to the wolf hider.<br /><br />It was also unfair of me to say that humans played especially poorly - mostly, penut just caused a LOT of chaos which kept people from noticing the obvious, so kudos to him for doing something i would have thought impossible.

				Yeah penut just kept up with his outrageous theories to the point where I doubted myself a few times. well played on his part.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t really see the power in Mystic&#039;s role exactly. He has to identify pairs with wolves in them and even then it&#039;s likely the damage in terms of role/info sharing is pretty much done.

				i think the funniest part of the game was when i added narwhal to the conversation with aj and me<br /><br />because i had to trust that what dieter and modi were saying was true. and i had fought so much against it that i actually started doubting it myself<br /><br />but i added him and told him that we were wolves and at the time i had a lot more credibility than he did so if he outed us i don&#039;t think anyone would&#039;ve believed him so i felt okay doing so<br /><br />ktern, why did you lie to us? at first, i understand. but after i told you we were wolves why did you keep that up?<br /><br />i had a lot of fun spewing as much bullshit as possible this game. i was surprised at how well that went. i think people should be a little more aggressive in the future (trient had a pretty compelling evidence that aj was a wolf and i think was the first to call both of us out really and then didn&#039;t really stick to that too hard) i had another example but i can&#039;t remember. modi probably could&#039;ve pushed back harder but i don&#039;t really know what to do about never having viewed dieter when it was a free action<br /><br />dieter dying was really funny and i was happy that he chose aj even if it was ultimately worse for us

				i had no idea ktern would be helpful to us. he had a lot of influence though and votes<br /><br />so my plan was to have narwhal hide behind him and then me link myself to him so that we&#039;d all be in contact and then feign ignorance about why it happened. because why would i do that and maybe then he&#039;ll back at least one of us up?<br /><br />and that would&#039;ve been really interesting to have to keep out all the knowledge narwhal and i have of each other from talking
