				snoop here, bitches<br /><br />i&#039;m throwin a house party, fo shizzle up in my nizzle<br />bottom line, i know there be some haters out there, and your job is to rid this place of those without beats. they all up in mah grill, fo shizzle<br /><br />i have placed undercover some of my main niggas to help me out, but they can&#039;t do all the work<br /><br />don&#039;t let me down, niggas. get rid of those haters that be hatin on us<br /><br /><br /><strong>List of Players</strong><br />[Host - snoop.gov]<br />1. Reapa&#039;<br />2. Dieter<br />3. mystic<br />4. LiquidAngel<br />5. RandomizeR<br />6. Enig.Matic<br />7. Phil<br />8. Az Real<br />9. Aponda<br />10. Lymric<br />11. That Kid<br />12. laserwolf<br /><br />Please refer to each other by forum names.<br /><br /><strong>you will all receive pms and roles, but not all of them will have abilities. it is a problem if you do not receive a pm, but not a public problem. send me a pm if you do not get a pm when i say pms are out. you will receive a name. these names may or may not hint at your role (a non-rapper in real life could be a rapper or not have a role) in general, do not use these to determine someone&#039;s role</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Basic Rules:</strong><br />There are 2 teams, haters(wolves) and rappers(humans).&nbsp; the object for either team is to eliminate the opposing team. Rounds are divided into nights and days.&nbsp; During the day, all players deliberate on who they think are haters and cast votes to <del>lynch</del>(we don&#039;t really like this word) beat someone.&nbsp; During the night, the haters decide on a target and are allowed to kill someone off. the rappers win when all the haters are dead, and the haters win when haters &gt;= rappers.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Other Rules Include:</strong><br />-No talking at night (This means no posting in this thread until I say the day has started)-niggas need sleep<br />-No private messaging to another player, meaning all discussion must happen publicly via posting. (rappers(Wolves) are allowed to communicate to each other privately)<br />-you must post at least once per &#039;day&#039;, or you will automatically get thrown out of the party (a vote for yourself)<br />-you may only vote thrice per &#039;day&#039;, meaning votes don&#039;t really matter and can only be changed twice once cast.<br />-haters and other special roles must send their nighttime kills/guards/sights within a reasonable period of time, preferrably less than 24 hours<br />-you may not copy/post any private messages from snoop or other players into the game<br />-No posting if you are dead (this should be obvious)<br />-All rules will be subject to my discretion<br /><br />If you do not know if you are allowed to do something, ask first!<br />Violaters of any of these rules will be!<br /><br /><strong>fucking secret roles<br />ask me questions because you should know what you&#039;re doing<br />it&#039;s okay if you don&#039;t. please ask. i understand that secret roles might be a bit much at this point, but i encourage you to ask questions</strong><br /><br /><strong>Guaranteed Special Roles:</strong><br /><span class="bbc_u">Seer</span> - <em>During the night, a seer has the ability to view one player to see their exact role (ie human guardian, or wolf, etc)</em><br /><br />in general (as a human seer) you want to target people who you think may be a wolf.&nbsp; If you find some fellow humans, you can try to form some kind of alliance.&nbsp; Be careful, because if you tell others you are the seer, you will become a big target for the wolves.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Guardian</span> - <em>During the night, a guardian may choose one player to guard.&nbsp; This player is protected from the wolves&#039; kill that night. If a player is successfully guarded (meaning it blocks a night kill), it will be announced that no night kill took place, but not who was guarded or even that anyone was guarded.&nbsp; Guardian cannot guard themselves, and cannot guard the same person twice in a row.</em><br /><br />in general you want to protect who you believe the wolves are going to kill.&nbsp; Keep this in mind if the seer comes out.&nbsp; Also, you can rarely be positive that anyone claiming to be a special is or not.<br /><br />props to reapa&#039; lol<br /><br />pms going out. i&#039;ll start when they&#039;ve all been sent<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size">bitches be talkin shit they be dead in seconds<br /><br />talk shit get hit, fo shizzle bitches<br /></span>

				i guess i shouldn&#039;t put words in your mouth<br /><br />i just jumped to a logical conclusion, as words such as &quot;incredibly suspicious&quot; do tend to rock people a bit. my only concern is that my ability will be wasted, so that&#039;s probably what caused me to get defensive.

				Well, I can only assume mystic is a human based on his anger about his role. Even though I don&#039;t know what the role is, the fact that it would only make sense for him and Reaper probably has something to do with low activity due to no internet. Haters need to be active.

				i just realized (actually i realized it half an hour ago and then thought about what to do about it) that i should probably add that there is a possibility of somewhat of a mark. also rule change at bottom<br /><br />new players should know this because they may not be familiar with it<br /><br />typically, a mark is a single-use ability the wolves have the choice of using any night instead of killing someone. the player the wolves choose to mark becomes a wolf and loses any other ability they might have had as a human. everything else is then the same as normal, just with another wolf. additionally, upon daybreak it is usually revealed that there was no night kill<br /><br /><strong>also typically, a strategic move is for the wolves to mark someone the seer has viewed as human. the idea is that the humans will assume the person is confirmed human when he is really a wolf </strong>(this is why i decided to include this, as it&#039;s new information for a lot of you)<br /><br />again, this is not definite and it will not be entirely as explained above. the bold part is what is important<br /><br /><br /><strong>rule change</strong>: sorry, i didn&#039;t go through reapa&#039;s rules enough to change the guardian role. before, in the event of a guard, the person guarded would be announced. now, upon daybreak, it will be revealed that there was no night kill<br /><br />new ruling: <br /><span class="bbc_u">Guardian</span> - <em>During the night, a guardian may choose one player to guard.&nbsp; This player is protected from the wolves&#039; kill that night. <strong>If a player is successfully guarded (meaning it blocks a night kill), it will be announced that no night kill took place, but not who was guarded or even that anyone was guarded.</strong>&nbsp;<br />Guardian cannot guard themselves, and cannot guard the same person twice in a row.</em>(copied from first post)<br /><br />again, i apologize for this<br /><br />also- again

				in the cornered state, with little more than 4 hours to live it seemed only appropriate to expose myself in hope of maybe living to see tomorrow. the only way I can think of that would be remotely conceivable to disprove me being seer would be if you were to make a counter-seer-claim or if you were the spy. Either of which is possible in this game, as snoop.gov has given a large number of roles out to the characters. I can prove myself human and seer if you wait until tomorrow, but again, it seems unlikely that I could do just that.

				So if Azrael really is a vigilante, and you, Phil, really are the seer, I think we, the real shit, need to make a decision. Assuming both of you are speaking the truth, have Azrael kill someone (so as to use his ability, and also make him a less desirable target, since he&#039;d no longer have a special ability, but at least be confirmed rapper), and then have the guardian protect Phil.<br /><br />Why is That_Kid voting for Lymric? I feel like we could be missing something there.<br /><br />Something else I am thinking about right now:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: LiquidAngel</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Only that_kid does it, and every time he does snoop comments on how he is a rapper for sure. Guys, mystic and that_kid = rappers.

We can very easily wait another day and have him use it then, when we have a better idea of who to suspect.<br /><br />Enig.matic, why are you predicting that Phil will kill you? I think that was your first post, so that&#039;s an absolutely bizarre comment to make.<br /><br />LiquidAngel is making sense so far. So he stays on my guest list.<br /><br />Phil, who do you plan on seering, then? We have the issue of only being able to protect the seer for one day, so if we force you to verify your identity by seering a likely human, we could be wasting any intel you could provide us. But it also means we know who you are for sure.<br /><br />Also, we now have Reaper either counter-claiming seer or claiming spy.<br /><br />And shit, we can get marked now, too. I don&#039;t feel like we can make a plan of attack now. Too many people making claims, not enough people keeping quiet.<br /><br />I still don&#039;t know whom to vote for..

				Dieter, I was wondering the same thing. Since this is still day 1, it is hard to figure out who I should see. you make very reasonable points about That_Kid, and Randomizer raised a bit of my suspicion as well. At thsi point I am open to any suggestions from &quot;the community&quot; as far as seering goes. Since I&#039;m out, it really doesn&#039;t matter whether or not I die tomorrow, so any viewable person is fine by me. Additionally I am still wary of aponda, who offered up a role, and it was admittedly beneficial to the Haters.<br /><br />Maybe viewing him tonight would be good. maybe Randomizer or that_kid.<br /><br />I still don&#039;t know.

				I think it comes down to: does the rapper team trust you enough to try and get useful intel?

				Now, that he has outed himself and we know marking can happen, he probably should use his ability today, since a wolf&#039;s mark will make him useless to us, but the danger there lies in not having any comfirmed IDs of any players except those with day1 confirmable roles. Guywithhat, it was pretty shitty of you to tell us that rule exists mid day, then maybe AJ would not have outed his role quite so quickly.

				Az real, kill Aponda today, based on his role claim. you will likely die or be marked tonight, either way, it will make you useless to our cause, and we have little mroe than suspicion to go by. I will likely die today. if I live to tonight, guardian, guard me.<br /><br />This will likely be my last computer time before 6.<br /><br />If I die, Happy wolf hunting, all.

				fuck, that&#039;s stupid, you&#039;re right<br /><br />the power to mark is not in this game<br /><br />marking(not actually marking) may occur, however<br /><br />i told you, the bold part is what is important, not the description of marking. though marking exists, it is not in this game. however, the bold part is still important, and that&#039;s what i wanted to tell you

				using his power now is not a good idea<br /><br />1. the chance of &quot;living the dream&quot; (killing a wolf) is really low<br />2. the chance of killing a useful role is pretty high<br />3. after aj becomes a confirmed human, <em>he will probably be marked</em><br />4. i have a sweet fucking vig plan but it requires a huge set up. but it will be awesome. it&#039;s too early yet though.

				I don&#039;t know what else to say, other than i have school, and homework, plus exams, so my time to use the computer is limited.<br />I also havent been talking, because other than a seer claim and a counter claim nothing else has happened.<br />Well, theres been a few role claims, but at this point, I dont think anyone can prove anything.<br />

				Shit man, somebody has to die. But I don&#039;t feel like there&#039;s anybody we can easily get rid of without much risk. For all we know, Lymric is the guardian or somebody who needs to keep quiet. Phil has his claims, which we&#039;ll verify tomorrow. Azrael, well, we&#039;ll see eventually, I guess.<br /><br />I kind of wish I had the option to vote for enig.matic because his accusations make no sense at all. Unless he&#039;s the town drunk? Probably not, but irrelevant here either way.<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember what exactly Randomizer said that seemed suspicious, but I just don&#039;t have a good feeling about it.

				I saw the voting line-up and didnt much care for the possibility of us voting out a seer. I changed my vote as to not conflict with the others. a lot of votes are thrown out because its half ass thrown out there through just random skepicism. I want the otha niggas to really think about their vote. Personally, fuck that hater Randomizer. He aint claim shit, nor prove it. But fuck Lymric too. Schools gay.

				Reaper is very convincing. Hell, we should probably lynch Phil tomorrow if something else doesn&#039;t develop.<br /><br />But it&#039;s worthwhile to let him live through tonight, right? Then in the event that he really is seer, we&#039;d know that Reaper is a liar. I feel like it&#039;s important to figure if Reaper is telling the truth. No harm in letting Phil live another night (well, besides potentially killing an innocent).<br /><br />Also, what if That_kid is the spy? Wtf else would he simply pull Lymric&#039;s name out of thin air? I&#039;m down to Randomizer and Lymric. What say have you, Randomizer?

				I hope rappers will see my logic here:<br /><br />clearly a well-informed vigilante is a powerful asset to the human cause. haters know who the other haters are, therefore it&#039;d be a simple matter for a hater to claim seer, id another hater, and insinuate that he also is vigilante, so as to discredit me.<br /><br />the second part of my forming theory is that, while unlikely in general, there may exist a sort of hater-vigilante as well (i say this only because it sounds like something matt would do). i only bring this point up to clarify that if i am vig-killed, it does not neccessarily clear randomizer and prove me a liar. conversely i have to accept the vice versa, and place myself under suspicion as well, but its something i&#039;m willing to do in order to give the haters as small an advantage as possible.

				So, speculation here. Was enig.matic&#039;s power to reveal who killed him? Phil and RandomizeR could be haters together hoping to take out any roles that claim otherwise. Other possibility is that to use his power Phil must take the life of another rapper. Considering he had his view right after enig.matic&#039;s untimely death.

				Also sounds like enig.matic has been marked.<br /><br />Phil, you and Randomizer aren&#039;t confirmed until he kills Azrael. If he can. If Azrael kills Randomizer, then you&#039;re up next.<br /><br />Also, hater vigilante = real?<br /><br />Edit x4: If enig.matic&#039;s journal is to be believed, Phil is telling the truth, and Aponda is a dirt bag. But again, verification is as easy as 1-2-3.

If they both have vig powers then the wolf vig could be &quot;confirmed.&quot; One killing the other doesn&#039;t confirm anything other than they had a power. It doesn&#039;t have bearing on which side they&#039;re playing for. Either way it&#039;s just going to be a huge brawl. Killing someone clearly stated as a hater in the NK post is probably a better idea.

Figured why the fuck not, and said phil was the one that was going to kill me. it happened to be that I faked my death to ensure this, but after awhile I noted that he was more than likely not a wolf, and possibly the seer (probably wrong, but oh well. Hes dead anyways so why do I give a fuck) and so I left a message after my initial death (not able to change it) saying phil killed me, but shortly thereafter left another explaining that Aponda played me for day 1 to kill phil. Aponda isn&#039;t doing much in the lines of threads, but more in the area of pms and that fucks with things. I want him out.

				So, let&#039;s recount what has happened in the last 24 hours. mystic gets killed (by the haters, apparently?), Enig.matic gets in a huge bloody brawl, and claims to have faked his death, but he (Tupac) is still alive. So, question is, is that some kind of power, or was he marked? Or better yet, I bet it&#039;s his power to change sides, seeing as how people cannot actually be marked.<br /><br />Waffles contributes nothing.<br /><br />If Azrael was the rapper vigilante, why would he kill the fake seer instead of the hater vigilante? Given, he may have thought (like I) that the hater vigilante used his power last night, but apparently not. But if I was the human vigilante, I would kill the poser to protect myself from retribution. So I&#039;m thinking that Azrael just wanted the real seer dead right now? I&#039;m not sure, I haven&#039;t been able to fully figure it out. It may still be possible that Azrael was the human vig and Randomizer is the wolf vig, but I have to think more.<br /><br />That_Kid&#039;s ability is to verify that he is indeed a rapper. So he can consistently confirm his status as rapper.<br /><br />Either way, sounds like Aponda is completely manipulating things?<br /><br />oh btw<br /><br />enig.matic is a HATER<br /><br />I cannot vouch for LiquidAngel, but I KNOW that I am not a hater. Unless this is just manipulation again by Aponda. But I feel like this is definitely a case of changing sides. Also, who takes suggestions from PMs and says &quot;Why the fuck not do what this random dude says?&quot;<br /><br />Also, I have received no PMs from Aponda. After thinking more, enig.matic is just trying to get us to lynch what is probably a human.

				you dont understand. My ability was not to change sides, it was to fake my death, and nothing more. Why would I have saved Phil back there if I knew he was a seer? Originally I wanted phil dead out of skepticism because I was almost certain he was a wolf, but upon further review he was (to me) the actual seer. As for Az Real, either he was a hater or honest to god confused. I think we all are, but as it goes we still cannot trust randomizer, but even so Aponda is shady (along with lazer) because of the lack of talk they do. However, that is beneficial because we all just end up assuming we all are wolves and end up fighting everyone else. Look, I left the note that stated phil was the fucka that done me in, because earlier I said if I died he was the one that killed me. Shortly thereafter I knew I probably fucked up, and now im showing you who the real hater is: aponda.

				I&#039;m actually most suspicious of Reapa&#039;. I would like to hear how he knows that Phil wasn&#039;t the Seer. But I also don&#039;t like that Az real just killed the person claiming seer, after being set up by Enig.Matic, only to be killed by another vig. &nbsp;I have a bad feeling that we haven&#039;t killed any wolves at all yet.

Also, he voted for me, but I don&#039;t think there is much to make about that yet.<br /><br />I read an old post by Aponda. He said something cryptic about the guardian. But this was also day 1.

				Already did, haha. If you note, everytime a human who doesn&#039;t have people to back him up and gives up trying to explain the fact that hes not a hater/wolf, is usually not a wolf. Think about that. Not to mention, my continuous claims that if I get lynched we waste a lynch / lose. If I end up dying from the lynch or the night, we will know that dieter is a hater.

				Why just dieter? Because, he&#039;s the only one you haven&#039;t accused yet?<br /><br />-Enig.Matic is being a bit cornered here as the tables have indeed turned<br />against him. He <em>did</em> lie about my sending a pm though, and I can&#039;t find<br />a reason that a human would need to do that.<br /><br />-Perhaps there is something we are missing, like a role that allows one person<br />to send a pm under another&#039;s name, but I would assume that this person would<br />need mystic to show them how?<br />

				No, RandomizeR means that Person a sends a message to snoop telling snoop to pass the message on to Person B under Person C&#039;s name. So snoop sends a PM to Person B with the message saying, &quot;This is from Person C.&quot;

				Let me just clarify what I think of Enig.Matic&#039;s abilities:<br /><br />Enigmatic was a human with ONE power (pretty sure he tattles on one of the wolves that killed him, or would have killed him). &nbsp;Then something or someone kept him from dying with some ability where he becomes a wolf, so in that sense he was affected by 2 abilities<br /><br />Again rereading his posts this makes the most sense to me.<br /><br /><br /><br />edit: enig.matic just posted and in response to that:<br /><br />If it changes based on the day, and you started as human, wouldn&#039;t you still be a wolf right now?&nbsp; With that in mind, why would a wolf tell humans about this?

Haha, cole) anywho, as you all should assume from now, I have abilities day by day, and as such, ive gained a new one. Now, this means we can vote two people to lynch. Why? you&#039;d like to know. Everyone give suggestions on who we kill today. This should slightly clear my name, but the fact that im taking into account the whole crew, rather than my selfish ideas (IE kill dieter right off) ill leave it up to you assholes.

				Yeah, but you were wrong about mystic. He can&#039;t fake his death. He can talk amongst the dead, much like tupac and probably give limit/ed messages each day.

				Anyway, my thoughts: Randomizer and LiquidAngel really want That_Kid dead. Why? Isn&#039;t it pretty much agreed that he&#039;s a rapper?<br />Also, did anyone else notice that Snoop hasn&#039;t confirmed That_Kid&#039;s identity yet? Could be the mark/convert we were thinking of, but until that happens, he&#039;s still a rapper.<br /><br />So it all comes down to LiquidAngel and Randomizer versus Reaper. Either LiquidAngel or Reaper is the sorcerer. Who did they have on their sides?<br /><br />LiquidAngel&nbsp; &nbsp;--&nbsp; Reaper<br />Randomizer&nbsp; &nbsp;--&nbsp; That_Kid<br />Phil&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&nbsp; Azrael<br /><br />I can&#039;t decide if Phil or Azrael was less insane.<br /><br />*time passes*<br /><br />Phil does not seem very believeable in retrospect. the way Azrael said <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,110.msg2935.html#msg2935">Quote from: Az Real on January 14, 2009, 02:52:53 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if i die here this is very fucked up<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> lends him incredible credibility, I feel like. It&#039;s about how I felt when enig.matic didn&#039;t die.<br /><br />in a different direction, why didn&#039;t Reaper die after saying on page 15 (D1) that he knows who the seer is?<br /><br />Hey, wait a second: Anybody notice this? Post #266 on page 18. LiquidAngel voted for Aponda. And this after he, the supposed 2-view spy, already knew Aponda was guardian.<br /><br />No way out of this one.<br /><br /><strong>LiquidAngel</strong>

Liquid and Dieter, however, only one can really be a wolf, and since liquid isnt campaigning for Dieter to die knowing he was bulletproof, I dont think dieter is a wolf.

				Well whateva&#039;. That&#039;s game. Humans win, good job. <br /><br />randomizer, change your vote to me.<br /><br /><strong>LiquidAngel</strong><br /><br />I&#039;m the final hater. Lymric was the other one. <br /><br />I don&#039;t actually know who the hater vig and sorcerer were, but my guesses were Phil and Azreal respectively.<br /><br />in my opinion humans were very over-powered in this game. He gave you a seer, vig, guardian, regenerater, confimed human and death speaker. Then on top of it he gave you a role that pretty much doubled each one. I assume tomorrow he&#039;d be either a seer or guardian.&nbsp; btw, I don&#039;t actually know if Aponda was the guardian or not, that was a guess, as was Dieter&#039;s role (lol, I based it on what Enig said Day 1 and the fact that snoop makes fun of &quot;bulletproof&quot; all the time). So yea, I&#039;ve pretty much been alone the whole game. I figured I would be fine as long as the seer didn&#039;t hit me. (Clearly that didn&#039;t happen)

MAYBE two. but with the way everyone &nbsp;was blaming like everyone else all the time and how everyone had different wolf ideas, it was unlikely that there was more than one wolf at that point. unless the wolves orchestrated a brilliant voting strategy, which i found unlikely (but it could happen: liquid isn&#039;t a bad player at all)<br /><br />all this assuming the game is over :x matt could make a new wolf but i think he might be tired of it or something<br /><br />and with balance, again in a team game, balance is difficult to measure, it&#039;s not a free for all. it does seem a little tipped towards the humans, but also look how far you got (and possibly could have gotten)<br /><br />pretty good parallel to a real gang battle though

				I think I was more in disbelief than anything. I thought he was an overpowered wolf. Hell, I had no idea what was going on with him. I didn&#039;t like that at all. Impossible to figure anything out. All I knew was that he wasn&#039;t possibly a friendly.<br /><br />Also, I was starting to doubt Reaper again. I don&#039;t know, I think I just kind of lost trust in everybody at the end because it was complete chaos. Nobody seemed concerned about KC, the two factions were trying to kill each other, and I was stuck trying to decide who was legit. Nobody made a good case at all, I could only find slip-ups.
