				Mafia Themed. I suck at writing, so I didn&#039;t come up with a story. While this is mafia themed, roles may or may not be named with the same names as used in the standard mafia game.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Basic Rules</span><br />There are 2 teams, Villager(Humans) and the Thugs (Wolves) the object for either team is to eliminate the opposing team. Rounds are divided into nights and days.&nbsp; During the day, all players deliberate on who they think are Thugs and cast votes to kill.&nbsp; During the night, the Thugs decide on a target and are allowed to kill someone off. the Villagers win when all the Thugs are dead, and the Thugs win when Thugs &gt;= Villagers.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Other Rules</span><br />-No talking at night. (This means no posting in this thread until I say the day has started)<br />-No private messaging to another player, or outside discussion, meaning all discussion must happen publicly via posting. (Thugs are allowed to communicate to each other privately)<br />-you must post at least once per &#039;day&#039;, or you will automatically get a vote for yourself.<br />-you may change your vote <strong>twice</strong> per &#039;day&#039; <strong>(Total, 3)</strong>.<br />-Thugs and special roles must send their nighttime kills/guards/sights within a reasonable period of time, preferably less than 24 hours.<br />-you may not copy/post any private messages from myself or other players into the game.<br />-No posting after you are dead.<br />-All rules will be subject to my discretion.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Guarenteed Roles</span> There will be at least one of these in this game.<br />Detective(Seer)<br />Martial Artist(Guardian)<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Players</span><br />1. Guy<br />2. Dieter<br />3. <del>Enig.matic</del> Day 1 Lynch<br />4. <del>That_Kid</del> Killed Night 1<br />5. Dr. Agon<br />6. <del>Ben</del> Suicide Night 1<br />7. <del>Reaper</del> Day 2 Lynch<br />8. LiquidAngel<br />9. Diage<br />10. <del>Dr. Death</del> Day 2 Gunshot<br />11.

				personally, if we can find a better suspect, i think it should be followed.. cause chances are he was joking since he said it so early in the game.. and if hes joking hes probably not a wolf.. but.. that shouldnt mean we assume he isnt i think we should attempt to deligate over some other options before directly assuming him and give him a chance to prove himself as well as a little time.. one wolf cant do that much damage i dont think? and i dont think its worth the loss of a human cause he made a joke like 5th post in

				obviously he thought we all would take it as a joke otherwise he would not of made it, he may make a joke like that every time I don&#039;t know, but it is suspicious.&nbsp; Everyone can still change their votes at least twice so its not a big deal.&nbsp; Matt was the first to vote and I consider that suspicious and I am acting just as suspicious as Ryan right now by explaining myself and accusing people.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t know and I have no idea if there is a good way to decide who to vote for.

				1. Im intrigued by what matt said, and so im probably not going to vote for him, and the idea of buffed masons is odd to me (I know, coming from previous host is pretty lol) however, if you think about it, thats what wolves are so im still a bit leery, if not more.<br />2. Ryan didn&#039;t do anything worth while, and I voted for him because he was being a jackass<br />3. Voting for inactives is suspicious because historically, all the people that have wanted it were wolves (hint hint)<br />4. a person working towards a tie is legitimately close to being a human just because they want to draw out the voting process, where wolves are eager to end it so they can do cool shit.<br />5. Theres patterns here guys, we just need to find them in what people do.<br />6. I know it might look suspicious that im setting all this stuff out, but im hopeful that this helps put my position on the &quot;suspected human&quot; field, rather than the polar.<br />7. Self examination is a good tool to prove sides.<br />

				well it&#039;s obvious from the night kill<br /><br />the wolves correctly assumed that that_kid was the other mason. they probably didn&#039;t know lovers and probably expected ben to be guarded, so why not kill the person that could confirm him?<br /><br />the fact that ben committed suicide shows that that_kid was the other lover. the only player to say anything about that_kid prior to the night kill in this way was dieter

				Oy.. under my rational belief.. ive tried to pick a pair of people where 1 wolf has a high probability between the two but more then likely are not both.. (that way i can eliminate two people w.o too much doubt).. from there on i used the remaining individuals to attempt to find a probability, i researched the posts of the people i figured had the highest chance.. thats only reason i say no to dieter.. just because he and guy seem at odds.. so i assume one or the other is likely a wolf or neither is a wolf, but more then likely not both. that allows me to leave 5 people not counting myself and a 40%... as i reviewed i have some faith in phils claims and kyles claims which leads it to three and that would then give me a 66%.. as i read through.. i feel reaper has the greatest number of contradictions.. thus why i have chosen him

I am seer, i viewed kyle.. he is a confirmed human and hes roll only happens when triggered by something.. i hope that way you can get two people out.. i got suspicious of reaper when his votes were towards people who i thought all human.. which would happen if he knew who the wolves were or he was really really unlucky since theres only 8 people.. then he contradicted himself soon after that

				i claimed priest last time because it was the most convenient at the time<br /><br />i have also claimed spy before. these facts do not mean that i am a wolf everytime that i claim these roles, or even that it is more likely<br /><br />and besides, those times i came up with it on the fly, it is obvious that this is not the case here

				i never said i could confirm anything<br /><br />i said it would be more useful if someone other than ben died, because ben dying only shows me that he is mason. i believed hijm because i doubted he would claim mason day one and have someone back him on it<br /><br />another random person is better because it presents new information rather than something we already assumed<br /><br />i&#039;m saying it&#039;s obvious that i didn&#039;t come up with it on the fly because i didn&#039;t start saying it just now or just when i claimed as i had before, i&#039;ve been saying it the entire game, and my posts reflect that

				I am the Hostage. you can guess that bad things happen when I die. Explicitly, townspeople lose. It wasn&#039;t specified in what timeframe; I would assume 2 days, given size of the game, worst case 1 day, but probably not instantly.<br /><br />There is a certain stipulation which is not wise to reveal at this moment. Well, I guess - having said that alone probably gives the thugs second thoughts. It&#039;s what also leads me to believe that the timeframe is relatively short.

Could also get killed in night - there are only three people left alive who haven&#039;t claimed roles yet (or at least divulged any information). Reaper said his isn&#039;t all that useful? Dr. Agon would prefer not to say it - I think at this point he is probably the guardian/martial artist, due to his reluctance. That leaves Dr. Death as potentially vigilante.<br /><br />Although it could just as easily be overlooked in favor of another power role, vigilante (or guardian) could very easily get killed tonight. Now that I think about it, guardian is almost certainly going to die.

				Kyle Ryan and Matt, you all just walked right into my trap. I knew after coming out, that the wolves would want me dead, and the 3 of you are pushing for that very aggressively, in hopes of being able to finish me off with a night kill. the 3 of you are batantly colaborating, because you know that if you can keep the three of you alive today, and kill one orson tonight that you win the game, but what you don&#039;t understand is that to me, and hopefully now to everyone else, you are very obviously wolves. <br /><br />Guy-being overly aggressive and controlling the game, under the disguise of a very claimable and unlikely role. I find it unlikely that KC didn&#039;t have any role at all, and as far as I know, the priest has never been granted the knowledge of the role of the person lynched, and anyone could have seen without your saying that Ben and Cameron were lovers.<br /><br />Kyle- your role doesn&#039;t make any damn sense in this game at all, and you are using Ryan&#039;s seer claim( which I will address her shortly) as a safeguard to make your self seem less suspicious. Furthermore I find it highly unlikely that you do not know what triggered your ability, and generally stupid that you would not follow up by saying anthing about your role and hoping that everyone else woid just get distracted by anything else and leave you alone, because the &quot;seer&quot;<br />Could confirm you.<br />Ryan-you played way to aggressively to be a seer even if you are a be player, that kind of reckless playing would be fitting of nothing but a wolf. you used Matt&#039;s claim of priest to mask your identity because Matt could easily say &quot;yes Ryan&#039;s seer, I know because seer isn&#039;t dead&quot; which doesn&#039;t make any sense. Considering the real seer is probably put there alive, and just doesn&#039;t have the ability to come out safely, becair he only has one person who will believe him versus your 3. <br /><br />Fuck you. Fuck you straight to hell.<br /><br />This took forever to type on my phone.

				I already said, &quot;Why the hell would I make up a role that doesn&#039;t make any damn sense?&quot;<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t if I were trying to fake a role I would&#039;ve claimed something that fit with the theme like Godfather or Snitch. Fact is, why would we try to kill you at night if we were wolves? That would be dumb. Your power would be gone so we could hit a higher value target. We would know you aren&#039;t the guardian or seer, so there wouldn&#039;t be a point to try and hit you. you have a lot of logic holes. <br /><br />I actually think you and Dieter are both wolves. the reason I want to test your ability is because if you die then that proves that you were a wolf, and futhermore, when you just stuck up for Dieter saying his role is believable (even though it clearly overbalances the game for wolves) gives evidence of you backing him up when he already seems suspicious. I wasn&#039;t thinking about trying to kill you until you made that bold statement, then I started to question whether you were being legit or not.

				you would make up a role that doesn&#039;t make any sense because in sich a role dense game, those are the ones likely to not be questioned. <br /><br />the three of you all have done nothing but &quot;confirm&quot; and back eachother up, and when I support a role intertwining with mine, I fail to see how that is any worse than what any of you have done,

				I said can produce. My ability triggered. Ryan can view someone tonight and come out with their role tomorrow. the power that was triggered in me was a guard ability, so I can guard him to make sure he won&#039;t be killed. If you&#039;re so worried about us trying to kill you we can have the real guardian guard you after we confirm if you&#039;re human or not. Since we can have 2 people guarded tonight chances are either Guy or myself will die. If not that they&#039;ll aim for Reaper or Dieter. <br /><br />the only problem with this is if the wolves kill the person Ryan views.

				No, he&#039;s right, I should shoot Danny. Danny is definitely bluffing about his role. Phil was too sure of the guardians death. That means either Cole or Danny has the ability to see dead roles or something like that. We already know Cole had the same power as Matt, who Guy confirms is human. Therefore, Danny has to be the one with the power.

				well, the thing with hostage was it was elaborately made to fit into phils role of swat.. it seemed strange to me that those both existed.. (tbh i think it was actualy good that i viewed kyle N1) furthermore, the fact that danny voted reaper right before the end of the clock after me is dead proof to me that he is a wolf.. only a wolf would do that to save phil.. and since phil is deffinatly a thug, danny thought theyd get the kill and the game would be over so he wouldnt have to worry about it. only reason i voted for reaper was cause i wanted it 4-3 and the ONLY way reaper would die is if he was lieing..

				right, I agree with this entirely, but phil obviously wants us to shoot danny, or he is using bad reverse psychology.&nbsp; I am just saying it seems like a bad idea at the time to use the gun on him.

				even tho, there is no negative outcome to shooting him first.. were basically all confirmed.. we lynch phil.. they have no way, if theres only two o well, it didnt give danny an advantage, if theres three then were on track.. plus itd save us just in case danny was in some way telling the truth about his role (which i doubt beyond the greatest doubts of my mind)

				Things I changed and whatnot:<br />Lovers were originally more powerful. Supposed to be an additional ability to their other roles, if they had them. I should of removed the suicide part, but didn&#039;t.<br />Lovers were supposed to be chosen by a third player, I felt an alliance of 3 human would be too powerful.<br />Added third wolf last minute.<br />Removed downside of Adept last minute, when I added third wolf. If Adept had less than 20 posts at the end of day 2, they would choose one player to kill, and then be converted to a Thug. <br />Adept was supposed to remain powerless until 40 posts. But felt humans needed a boost after day 1.<br />Added Politician/Savvy Thug last minute.<br />All players were not supposed to originally have a role. Just sorta ended up like that.<br />Was supposed to be set in a small village originally, with some small backstory. <br />Forgot what a single mafia member was called, so went with thug.<br /><br />

				you did a pretty good job, and at least attempted to balance it.<br /><br />But too many roles. I was the only one without an ability.
