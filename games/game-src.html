				You all awake in your beds to the sound of a siren striking fear into your hearts. In the small Appalachian town of Mystic River you almost never hear sirens. They always bring terrible news.<br /><br />Today is no exception. You leave your houses, some half-dressed, and head towards the source of the ominous sound. There is a commotion out by the docks and you form a crowd around the police tape to watch the sheriff and his deputy dragging a body from the river that is your town&#039;s namesake. Some scream, some burst into tears, others demand to see who it is, to know what happened to him. The officers roll the sodden corpse onto its back, in view of the crowd.<br /><br />&quot;NO! It&#039;s Death Butt!&quot; cries Dr Agon.<br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; replies the sheriff in gruff despair. &quot;It&#039;s Dead Butt.&quot;<br /><br />Death Butt, beloved mayor and friend to all residents of Mystic River lies dead before you. His flesh is pale and ghostly, his dripping clothes stained in dark blood mixed with the mud of the river.<br /><br />&quot;What happened to him?&quot; is the cry from AngryNarwhal, shouting above the hushed whispers, gasps and sobs.<br /><br />The sheriff stands in front of the body and addresses the crowd seriously, slowly eyeing everyone from behind his dark aviator sunglasses.<br /><br />&quot;He&#039;s been murdered.&quot;<br /><br />Not a single murder has occured in your town for as long as anyone can remember. The sheriff and his deputy spend most of their time assisting the residents of their small jurisdiction and making arrangements in the rare occasion someone passes from disease or accident; crime is hardly even in their job description. Shocked and confused, but mostly deeply saddened, the crowd disperses to resume their days while a few stay behind to assist the policemen with the body.<br /><br />The next day Xazarus is found dead in the street, bloody and beaten, but nobody seems to care too much. The police scrape him off the pavement.<br /><br />Several days later, the whole town turns out for Death Butt&#039;s funeral. It is a solemn affair and everyone takes a turn to say a few words about their departed friend.<br /><br />As the burial draws to a close, the sheriff addresses the crowd.<br /><br />&quot;As you all know, Death Butt was murdered. My deputy and I have been investigating to the best of our ability but have not been able to uncover much. He was found along the riverside by some passing boaters, who called us to the scene. He had recieved several blows to the head and body as well as some minor lacerations. It appears that the cause of death was blunt trauma to the head and that he was killed a few hours after midnight. We are asking you to help us in our search for the killer.<br /><br />&quot;Each day we must choose one person to be hanged by the neck until dead, until the murders stop. If they are innocent they will join Death Butt at the foot of Our Lord. If they are not, well, I think we all know what will happen to them.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Rules:</strong><br />I am the rules.<br /><br />Standard TWG rules unless otherwise specified.

				I generally disagree with the notion that if all information was revealed that it does not benefit the humans (which isn&#039;t what was said, but I wanted to say that anyway).&nbsp; The problem is that players are going to throw misinformation in there, often regardless of if they are humans or wolves, so it becomes figuring out who is telling the truth, and who is lying, and why are they lying.<br /><br />its okay though, that was a well thought out response.&nbsp; you will always play to have your team win (except that one time modi came out as a wolf to try to make the other wolf party lose).<br /><br />I&#039;m fine to move my vote elsewhere now.&nbsp; <strong>guy</strong> what about you?

It&#039;s flavor text, and highly unlikely to be relevant.

However, there&#039;s already a decent explanation to the second murder from both a flavor point of view and a cold, calculating game player point of view. From a flavor point of view: murderers like to kill people. They killed someone that nobody cared about, though. Happens all the time, and I am sorry it had to happen. Unfortunately, there don&#039;t seem to be any clues in the manner of death.<br /><br />From a game view, that was included because there was originally going to be another player and then he vanished. Maybe if there were the possibility of some sort of secret zombie ghost player, it would be more worthwhile to continue this train of thought, but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything to say about this little bit of flavor - and certainly nothing we can know. It&#039;s definitely not suspcious that other players have been ignoring the second murder, and it is in fact more suspicious that we are talking about it at all.

				I&#039;ll put my vote on <strong>Dr. Agon</strong> for now because I don&#039;t want my vote to be on me and because he seems to be picking on easy targets. I had two votes on me (one of which was my own vote), heck lets throw another one in there?&nbsp; I think he did the same thing to guy. I don&#039;t want that happening. I also do think that he is changing his vote around a ton. I don&#039;t know if it is just to get the game going, or to cause confusion.&nbsp; I understand that with the new vote conditions we may need to move around our votes a little bit, but I just see it as too much unstableness.

				you really only had one vote.&nbsp; nobody is going to get themselves lynched without putting a vote out on someone else.&nbsp; and do we want stability?&nbsp; stability leads to stagnation, which benefits the wolves.<br /><br />and I did do the same thing to guy, because I knew that this morning was the last time he was going to be active (most likely) before day ended and I wanted to be sure he&#039;d do something (which he didn&#039;t).<br /><br />In the same way you are picking on me, an easy target, should we question that?

				<br />The day stretches on with deliberations, long &#039;bathroom breaks&#039;, and some halfhearted searching for clues. As the sun goes down and twilight sets in the small community gathers in the town square, where the Sheriff addresses the good people of Mystic River from atop a newly-erected gallows.<br /><br />&quot;My friends,&quot; he begins, &quot;we are beset by a depraved and vicious enemy who lurks within our ranks. We have forever lost one of our most beloved friends, and Xazarus. I fear that tonight they will strike again if we do not act.<br /><br />&quot;This must be a community decision. I know it is not easy to send a neighbor to his demise but unfortunately there is no other way. We must find and destroy this madman, or madmen, before it is too late. Now. Let us come to a decision.&quot;<br /><br />The crowd begins to argue amongst themselves. Accusations fly left and right until eventually Iron and Dr Agon are pulled apart from an imminent fistfight by their respective supporters.<br /><br />&quot;STOP!&quot; Cries an unbiased third-party spectator. The commotion comes to a standstill at this unexpected interruption. &quot;This is insane! Nobody&#039;s got any proof of anything whatsoever! We can&#039;t just randomly choose someone to die! We&#039;d just be killing more innocents! Stop this madness!&quot;<br /><br />After a beat the crowd continues its commotion. The community is clearly divided between Iron and Dr Agon, neither of whom seem particularly upset by the threat of their impending doom. <br /><br />The clocktower slowly rings its large bell nine times, the ominous ringing lays bare the tension between the quarreling townsfolk and the square falls silent. Who will make the first move?<br /><br />Iron steps towards Dr Agon.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, I just realized, I&#039;ve got more people on my side than you! Let&#039;s get him, guys!&quot;<br /><br />Dr Agon sighs and looks up at the gallows. &quot;Well, so much for that.&quot;<br /><br />The clock tower rings its large bell eight times.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Dr Agon</strong> is dead. Night 1 begins.<br /><br />Get those PM&#039;s in; you have until 12:50 AM Friday or they will not be accepted. I&#039;d prefer to have them in before then though. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.<br /><br />I&#039;ll announce start of day 24 hours in advance.

				Being close to lynched is actually a piece of evidence that I am human. If I were a wolf there would probably have been a larger attempt to save me.<br /><br />I saved myself with weird tiebreak rules, but if someone else had gone online first it could easily have gone the other way.

				That would be true if it was not already confirmed that there could be more than one murderer. Why would the other person/people risk saving just one of their own so early in the game? Loosing one seems like it wouldnt be the big of a deal if it threw the scent in a different direction. Also if &quot;Wolves, have greater communication ability than humans, are better able to respond to such emergencies&quot; it also seems strange to me that someone immediately came to your aide

				It would depend on how subtly they could do it, I suppose, and how confident people were that the lynchee was a wolf. <br /><br />D1, people are pretty apathetic. It was only a tie because the Dr. tried to save himself, and he only got lynched because I showed up to save myself in turn.<br /><br />Just conjecture, of course. I don&#039;t have anything solid against you but I think you are worth investigating.

				I don&#039;t really see reason to assign motive to it, or identify it as anything more than a random kill. It&#039;s worth bearing in mind that we probably don&#039;t have more than two wolves in this game, so the odds of their having a very strong effect on voting outcome are small. It&#039;s entirely possible that all of the wolves <em>were</em> voting for you, Iron. Or for dr.agon. After all, 7 of 9 players were involved in that stand-off.

				I feel like picking on Swoop is exactly the type of thing the wolves want us to do.&nbsp; Modi was someone that did not really have many people picking on him and he was not a real threat to anyone yet as far as I can tell. Swoop was Modi&#039;s one and only vote for someone, and he was the only vote on Swoop at the end of the day. Not very threatening. Also, if a wolf were to kill off the person that voted for them day one, that just seems like a bad move overall because then they would be pointed out as a wolf quite easily. <br /><br />That all said I&#039;m watching Iron, but understand that voting for Swoop is not the most horrible thing to do ever, because hey, he may be a wolf that panicked and decided they had to kill off the person that voted for them right away.<br /><br />I feel suspicious of <strong>Angry Narwhal</strong> too because he hasn&#039;t had any votes for him yet this game.

				No, they are not the single most valuable and important piece of evidence in the game. The content of discussions and voting records are much, much more important. Placing a lot of meaning on night kills without evidence from the discussions and voting records first and foremost is an exercise in futility. And I would much rather see people use evidence from discussions and voting records while forgetting the night kills than the reverse.<br /><br />Also it&#039;s really dumb to vote for someone just because they say something about strategy that you disagree with.

				To put it another way, I&#039;m pissed off because there&#039;s this group of people who seem to be trying to find Freddie Krueger when they should be looking for Ted Bundy.<br /><br />Think for a moment about various metas (http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=JEEP%27s_Tells_for_Finding_Mafia) that have been introduced into the game. Third vote on any bandwagon is likely to be a wolf. Players who congratulate the guardian on a successful protection is likely to be a wolf. People who pick up on tells/hints easily, especially with less experience/skill, are more likely to be mafia. And so on and so forth.<br /><br />Fundamentally, what is it about these things that makes them possible tells? It certainly isn&#039;t something magical about the number 3 that all players become attracted to once they become wolves. It&#039;s the fact that wolves do not like to challenge; they prefer to charm. That&#039;s what makes matt miller so fucking lethal as a wolf; being likeable for pretty much the entire game comes naturally to him, as well as manipulating people into doing things his way, even against their better judgement.<br /><br />On the other hand, humans, especially humans with more or less expendable roles, tend to be substantially more ballsy. Humans will declare that something doesn&#039;t matter right now, apply votes based on intuition rather than &quot;safe&quot; reasoning, and question what&#039;s going on for the purpose of figuring it out, not pushing a goal. Humans do not need to try to pass beneath the eyes of the seer, to protect known teammates, or to draw attention to innocent players in the hopes of falsely incriminating them. Humans simply do not make as much of an effort to play it safe, because they do not <em>need</em> to play it safe.<br /><br />If any player is really, totally fixated on the idea that I am guilty because of this one sentence:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1114.msg50305.html#msg50305">Quote from: eep on December 13, 2013, 07:08:44 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Plus, there&#039;s not really any reason to read into wolf kills at this point in the game.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then I seriously suggest that you examine the implications that you believe come along with it. Did I advocate not looking at the wolf kill at any point in the game? No. I said that, at present, the amount the we could draw from the kill did not strike me as sufficient to justify a focus on it. Furthermore,<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1114.msg50320.html#msg50320">Quote from: AngryNarwhal on December 14, 2013, 03:38:41 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As far as eep, yeah I&#039;d say your response is also fairly reasonable, but I find it very telling that you want to draw attention away from the one piece of evidence that a wolf can&#039;t hide, cover up, distort, lie about, etc.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not even true. Any exercise in trying to determine the motivation behind a particular night kill is futile, because a wolf chooses the kill, typically, with some thought regarding the effect it will have. Putting aside possibilities like bombs, vigilantes, and other means by which a wolf kill might be obfuscated, a wolf can deliberately <em>use</em> a kill to hide, cover up, distort, lie about their identity. And, in fact, night kills are the least reliable sort of evidence, because wolves can do them without providing <em>any</em> public rationale for their decisions. So, yes, I want to draw the focus away from idle speculation regarding why the wolves killed Modi.<br /><br />Lastly, Iron&#039;s role is most likely survivor. I don&#039;t know whether his role is at odds with human or wolf victory, but it is a risk that his would take priority. I recommend against allowing him to live if he does not, fundamentally, play the game as a human. Here are my reasons for thinking this is his role:<br />(1) His vote on Swoop <em>was</em> opportunistic and poorly supported, regardless of swoop&#039;s alignment.<br />(2) He has stayed staunchly unopinionated throughout the bandwagon on me, which would keep him out of harm&#039;s way regardless of which side has wolves involved.<br />(3) He suggested that a third faction exists:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1114.msg50201.html#msg50201">Quote from: Iron on December 10, 2013, 07:57:33 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Or perhaps I smell a third faction</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				I will outright claim that I received no information about a third faction. I said that in response to something vorporeal said.<br /><br />My vote on Swoop was no big deal. It was the first vote of the day.<br /><br />I have not been unopinionated on the bandwagon on you. <br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s another opinion that you could probably already pick up from my last few posts:<br />Too much of what is going on right now is centered on eep. That&#039;s never healthy. Hell, that&#039;s where the meta about &quot;third on a bandwagon&quot; comes from.<br />So I agree with anything eep says about examining other possibilities, though I disagree with a lot of what she&#039;s said about meta/strategy.<br /><br />As I said before this wild bandwagon appeared, everyone should be looking for some sort of tell as early as possible and doing what they can to investigate it. We&#039;ve got three tells being explored right now, neither enough for a conviction but both, IMO, real data. (Swoop vs Modi, eep vs what counts as a tell, eep vs Iron&#039;s neutrality).&nbsp; More would be better, and it&#039;ll be easier after a vote count.

				I am sufficiently convinced by eep/ what she said wasn&#039;t EXTREMELY wolfy in the first place. Yes, at the beginning of the day, it seemed like something worth grasping on, but let&#039;s all get a hold of ourselves.

				My guesses are that eep is either human and has no real helpful power, human with a helpful power or wolf.<br />Really narrows it down huh? not really but I&#039;ll explain.<br /><br />With all the pressure on her if she had a role that would be helpful to he human side, my guess is that she would have told us about it. Perhaps there is a hint somewhere from her that I missed, but I did not see her come right out and claim a role. It could also be that if she does have a power that it would benefit the wolves more to know about it than it would the humans. Or she could just be a wolf.<br /><br />But to me, being a wolf at this point doesn&#039;t seem all that likely seeing her reactions. I&#039;m going to be really mad though if she was a really persuasive wolf. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to <strong>unvote</strong> for now.<br /><br />The bandwagon really happened pretty quickly, and I admit I voted for eep because something sounded fishy about avoiding analyzing night kills, but now I see what she meant. I&#039;d like to keep her around a little longer! But really, we should try to get votes in before the day gets too near the end. I do not really like what happened yesterday. Whoever of the ties logs in first gets to move on? I dunno about that. Perhaps there should be a rule that you cannot be the one to save yourself or something for future games if they use this mechanic.

				Hooray, another tie going into the last day. Personally I&#039;d prefer Swoop dying than eep, though I won&#039;t rule out that she is a wolf - just that nothign she&#039;s done has said she&#039;s a wolf.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really have the power to end this tie, however.

				eep&#039;s argument that NKs have low entropy is very convincing.&nbsp; It is true that wolves have a lot of ability to guide early discussion through their choice of NK, and therefore we shouldn&#039;t weight it too heavily in decision making during the day.<br /><br />I&#039;m not clear on why I&#039;m now being perceived as a wolf/threat.&nbsp; Most of the info about me is a lack of info (I&#039;ll try to think &quot;aloud&quot; more), and the two votes I&#039;ve made so far.&nbsp; Neither of my votes were suspicious or opportunistic - one was the first vote yesterday against Iron (who others have since voiced some concern about), and another was the second vote today against eep (which was the result of my equivalent of Narwhal logic).<br /><br />Any thoughts on why Narwhal started a voting run on me after eep lowered her threat level?&nbsp; As a corollary, why would I be the logical choice if nobody else is suspicious yet (stated by Swoop when placing vote #2 on me)?<br /><br />For now, I&#039;ll move my vote to <strong>Swoop</strong> to protect myself (which I think is a logical/reasonable play independent of role - I can&#039;t think of a reason someone would leave themselves vulnerable).

				The two people on the chopping block right now do not seem all too worried. I really think that they both are human players. Nobody is coming to their aid. Everyone is just being herded like sheep to vote on two people.

				Swoop - Iron, eep, vorporeal<br />guy - trientalis<br />trientalis - guy, narwhal, swoop<br /><br /><br />So there was a tie between Swoop and Eep. Then it was a tie between Swoop and Vorp. Then a tie between Swoop and Trientalis. See? That&#039;s ridiculous.<br /><br />Most of these were led by guy. He doesn&#039;t deny this. That could mean he&#039;s covering up for saving eep, or it could mean he&#039;s indecisive, or it could mean he&#039;s doing a good job putting pressure on everyone equally. Quite a few possible reads there. I don&#039;t agree when guy says &quot;i don&#039;t choose who the targets are&quot; but I guess his record is mixed.<br /><br />Swoop&#039;s consistent presence in the tie makes him seem human. The fact that he has been along on those ties makes him seem wolfy to me (because it saves him, in part - something anyone would do I suppose). <br /><br />Then there&#039;s Narwhal, who is still really unscathed. Trientalis calling this out is what first drew attention to her. I don&#039;t think she&#039;d do that as a wolf unless she had some people behind her.<br /><br />I&#039;m not too super worried about any particular person dying. Everyone&#039;s been active and no one&#039;s claimed any harder than anyone else if at all. So I will vote for<br /><br /><strong>Narwhal</strong> and see where that goes. Note this breaks the tie in favor of lynching Trientalis, whom I don&#039;t really think is wolfy, but not near 100%.

				i agree with a <strong>trientalis</strong> lynch, but I also suspect that one of the two people on the chopping block were wolves. It would put trientalis in a position that would make her reluctant to vote for either of them, because there&#039;s really no way to win.

				I&#039;ve been framed. I am human but apparently the mason I am with wants to kill me or doesn&#039;t trust me. Swoop was supposed to be working with me. But now he basically threw me under the bus. I am human. I am your sheriff, people of Mystic River. There still are more people than wolves I am guessing, and if I die tonight, you know that I am human, but if I don&#039;t I guess you can lynch me the next day if you feel I am a threat.<br /><br />I could force a tie by voting for my deputy.

				Look at the way narwhal left me to die he is a wolf. <br />Look at the way the person I have been protecting the entire day because I &quot;knew they were human&quot;. I&#039;ve been a fool, and clearly Swoop is wolf as well.<br /><br />I easily could have saved Swoop when it was a tie vote between Vorporeal and Swoop. It is a sting. Narwhal set me up to kill Vorporeal who now I see is clearly a human. They knew I thought Swoop was human and that is why Narwhal was so mad that I was not taking his bait and killing off vorporeal, instead of my supposed partner when that big tie was going on. <br /><br />I guess this is goodbye, humans of Mystic River. This is the best I can do for you as Sheriff. It was nice knowing you.

				<br />The day gets heated as it draws to a close, even more than the previous day. Opinion shifts in wild swings, a mob-like mentality swinging from player to player until it is split between Trientalis and Swoop.<br /><br />&quot;Swoop!&quot; cries Trientalis, &quot;How could you betray me? You&#039;re my deputy! Guys, don&#039;t you recognize me?? I&#039;m the Sheriff for crying out loud!&quot;<br /><br />The rest of the town is surprised by this outburst. Swoop scratches his head and says, &quot;Uhh, I&#039;m not really sure what you&#039;re talking about, Trient. I like, don&#039;t even know you. Besides, we all know who the sheriff is, right guys? It&#039;s uhhh... Wait, who <em>is</em> the Sheriff?&quot;<br /><br />A ripple of murmurs ripples across the crowd. &quot;<em>Is she the Sheriff?</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>I thought we didn&#039;t have a sheriff...</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>Isn&#039;t Death Butt the Sheriff?</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>She could be the Sheriff, I don&#039;t really remember.</em>&quot; Nobody can quite remember who the sheriff is, or indeed, if the town of Mystic River actually had one. &quot;<em>Surely there was someone who was acting as Sheriff, wasn&#039;t there?</em>&quot; &quot;<em>Come to think of it, the Sheriff was the one who found the body in the first place. Should we even trust the Sheriff?</em>&quot;<br /><br />Swoop Doggy Doge calls out to the crowd, &quot;Let&#039;s lynch this liar! Look at how she&#039;s connived and tricked us, and is now pretending to be a figure of authority in order to have her way! Surely, Trientalis is the murderer!&quot; The crowd roars enthusiastically as Trientalis is dragged to the gallows.<br /><br />&quot;Wait, wait!&quot; she screams, &quot;You&#039;re making a mistake! Swoop is the real murderer! Him and Narwhal and guy are all in on it together! Mark my words!&quot; But her pleas fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />Someone wearing a Sheriff&#039;s hat and star appears on the gallows and addresses the crowd, &quot;I am the Sheriff, and I always have been! Kill this imposter!&quot; The townsfolk stare at the self-proclaimed Sheriff and look puzzled. Is this the Sheriff who&#039;s been leading the town the past few days? It could be, who knows? It&#039;s strangely hard to remember. It would be good if someone had a picture of the Sheriff or something so they could check, but none can be produced. The town collectively decides to go with it. Who are they to doubt the Sheriff?<br /><br />&quot;If you&#039;re the sheriff,&quot; shouts eep, &quot;Then how come that Sheriff is wearing the hat and star?&quot; The crowd murmurs appreciatively at this question.<br /><br />&quot;That Sheriff stole them from me!&quot; cries Trientalis, &quot;Please bel...&quot;<br /><br />Her words are cut short as the block is knocked from under her feet. Trient jerks her body violently as her face swells and turns a bright red. The town watches silently as the struggle for precious life fades from her body until she is swinging slowly, gently, in a good approximation of a simple harmonic oscillator.<br /><br />The clocktower chimes its mournful tone six times as the sunlight fades behind the trees.<br /><br />&quot;Fuck,&quot; says Iron, &quot;Somebody needs to fix that clock.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><strong>Trientalis</strong> is dead. Night 2 begins.<br /><br />Send me your PM&#039;s within 24 hours.

				swoop- did you lie about not knowing anything about what trient was talking about?<br /><br />i don&#039;t really think she would make up that much when you could easily say no. it doesn&#039;t make sense. and seeing as you&#039;re fairly new, i figured maybe you denied it just so you didn&#039;t go down with her<br /><br />in any case iron left a note on my door and then also died in front of my door. i was informed this was the second time i found a body outside my door, though i was not told about it the first time. it said that he also had mason like powers. so i ask- who with<br /><br />i also wonder if this is why he died, considering killing me would make a lot of sense after a mason claim that was accepted

				I have no idea where trient got that information. She was correct about me being deputy but she is most certainly not the sheriff. I followed iron last night and saw him leave the note on your door but someone came out from the side of guys house and cut him in half before i could stop him and find out what was going on. Theres the whole deal, Im not sure how trient figured out how i was the deputy but i can tell you that she was NOT the sheriff

				no haha that seems reasonable enough<br /><br />it also makes it really easy to confirm<br /><br />vorporeal- did you receive that note?<br /><br />also swoop- how did you know trient was lying? why do you think she wasn&#039;t sheriff? you still haven&#039;t explained that. did you learn from following iron who the sheriff is? what else could iron do?<br /><br />if you know who sheriff is it&#039;s understandable that you don&#039;t want to out them, but at least let us know that that&#039;s the case. really i just want to know how much we can assume trient was actually a wolf, because i&#039;m not sure either way at the moment<br /><br />also if you know what the sheriffs powers are i don&#039;t see a reason not to let us know

				okay so at this point there&#039;s no reason for us to not pressure swoop into telling us who his partner/sheriff is<br /><br />the person he claims can say yes or no easily and then we know he&#039;s lying. if they back him up, that&#039;s two people we know not to vote for at the moment<br /><br />seeing as how we&#039;re running out of possibilities, i doubt this strategy is favorable for swoop if he&#039;s lying, which i think he is

				Still no one has come forward about these mason claims.

Guy was the first to claim mason powers if i recall. or narwhal. But one of them is lying if there are only two masons

				I think a swoop/trient team would be running an extremely poorly judged gambit by letting trient get lynched rather than, y&#039;know, just voting vorporeal. <br /><br />It does make some sense that if Swoop doesn&#039;t want to out the Sheriff, than the Sheriff doesn&#039;t either.

				Well. I&#039;m not sure.<br />I explicitly claim not-sheriff.<br /><br />A scenario you are overlooking is the possibility of a wolf sheriff. A human Swoop would be easy for a wolf sheriff to throw under the bus. <br />Though, if I were to speculate, a deputy who can&#039;t be brought to reveal the sheriff&#039;s identity probably couldn&#039;t vote for them, either, strengthening one of guy&#039;s points.<br />But at that point a wolf deputy seems at least as likely as a wolf sheriff, and a wolf team making stuff up seems most likely of all. A swoop/vorp team at this point in the game would be devastating, and that&#039;s what I strongly believe we have on our hands. I can&#039;t think of any reason for wolf Swoop to claim there&#039;s a living human Sheriff when there isn&#039;t. And I think we have used sufficient logic to determine that much. <br /><br />Come to think of it, that strongly implies that Trient was telling the truth. <br /><strong>swoopdoggydog</strong>

				i mean it is not totally out of the question that the sheriff might not know that they are the sheriff (certainly it was hinted in the flavor text that someone else was the sheriff, though that is not reliable; and also guy has mentioned today that he was given information that he apparently was not aware of previously), and i definitely find swoop suspicious enough that i will not object to his being lynched.<br /><br />but there are also reasons why vorp is substantially suspicious, including trient&#039;s reluctance to vote him for kinda shady reasons. I suppose my big question is just why order would <em>fundamentally</em> matter at this point in the game, when i see it as pretty much a throw-up between these two.<br /><br />i guess there is the fact that i&#039;m not necessarily confirmed to you and narwhal, though i keep forgetting that haha

				furthermore, if narwhal were the unkillable sheriff, why hide that until the last minute before sniping the vote?<br /><br />part of me is definitely worried about you, too, guy, but narwhal has done more overtly fishy things. plus, if trientalis was a wolf, how did she know swoop was deputy? maybe she had her own role, or maybe she was in communication with the sheriff.

				well fundamentally i&#039;m supposed to believe narwhal is on my side because we&#039;re masons<br /><br />and if i recall correctly you&#039;re one of the only to have never claimed a role<br /><br /><br />also, narwhal was the only reason swoop wasn&#039;t killed. swoop was night killed, so that leads me to believe he was both human and telling the truth. this leads me to believe narwhal further. and because you tried to off swoop when narwhal sniped the vote in his favor<br /><br />oops, but that&#039;s what the evidence shows. <br /><br />

				Yeah, I&#039;m sheriff, I was holding out hope that the wolves would try to NK me but decided in the end to save Swoop. I was like 90% that he was human. We were only allowed to send one message each night - I sent him an &quot;assignment&quot; and he &quot;filed a report&quot; when it was done. I can&#039;t 100% verify that he did what he said he did, but everything he said about his following Iron etc. was what was in his reports as well.<br /><br />I will continue to trust guy over <strong>eep</strong>, I haven&#039;t seen him do the slightest wolfy thing this game. I know he&#039;s a crafty wolf, but I got more weird vibes from Swoop than from him, and we were able to talk quite a bit more.

				and there are other points worth considering, too:<br /><br />(1) Did Narwhal know that you were also in communication with Modi as of N1?<br />(2) Why were Modi and Iron the first two night kills? Iron, in particular, was an odd choice after the mason claim. In fact, it&#039;s generally just odd that both of you have been left alive to this point in the game.<br />(3) Why was guy given two players to be in contact with? that has the potential to be a really fucking overpowered mason alliance unless it is somehow subverted.<br />(4) Why was narwhal given (at least) two players to be in contact with, one of whom couldn&#039;t vote for him? do you really think the most likely scenario is one in which 4 human players were connected and semi-confirmed to one another?<br /><br />and so on and so forth.

You navigate through his personal folders, looking for something of interest. Not much presents itself. Quicken files, folders of cat pictures, furry trap hentai, nothing you haven&#039;t before. You open his web browser, aghast that all you can find is Nestscape Navigator, and check his cookies for sites that may have saved his login info. You fail to find any email services or social media accounts; only a weird collection of forums for porn, conspiracy theories, bald men support groups (yes, several), ghost/UFO pictures, and something about TWG, whatever that could be. You don&#039;t even want to guess. <br /><br />Discouraged and frankly, mildly disgusted, you break the link and turn off your computer.

From behind a bush across the street you watch him walk up the front steps, place a piece of paper on his door and leave. <em>That was weird</em>, you think, <em>but this is my chance!</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You wait a little while longer before daring to venture out of your hiding spot but nothing seems to be happening.

				Well, that didn&#039;t go perfectly. I think it was a bit imbalanced in the wolves&#039; favor, especially since Modi got NK&#039;d so quickly. More humans would have helped a lot. I should have pushed for more to join.<br /><br />Sorry about the ending there, eep. I had to let the day go on in case Narwhal decided he had to lynch guy or something, but the odds were not in your favor. You probably had the most disappointing game, with nobody visiting you at night.<br /><br />But, I had a lot of fun running this one and hope you guys had fun playing it. Thanks to all for playing!<br /><br />Also, I had a dead thread running for most of the game, just for people to discuss the game: http://www.quicktopic.com/50/H/eJ98dVhtm9DzW<br /><br />The thread had no influence on the game.

				I feel like this game could have been really good had there been more people(human players) involved and had the people who actually were involved been able to spend a little more time on here playing the damn game

				I&#039;m also sort of feeling that twg might work better for us at this point in our lives if we could just make it an irc thing. these games are really just that much more frustrating when you need to sit around waiting 24 hours for people to respond and then they give a bullshitty response and then you need to wait another 24 hours.

When the wolves are so dominant, as in this game, it&#039;s hard to fight upstream like that.<br /><br />Between all the wolves&#039; roles and masonry and such, the wolves knew nearly everything that was going on, while the humans actually had a ton of misinformation. A 9 man game is hard anyway, and all human roles got stifled this time.

				Obviously I expected my snipe vote to end the game in the wolve&#039;s favor. But when the game didn&#039;t end, I couldn&#039;t think of any reason not to when it was 2 wolves vs 2 humans except for some weird third party things. Swoop had been acting weird the whole game - he didn&#039;t tell me any of the crucial information he received in PMs, and at one point he asked me for confirmation that we were on the same team. So I naturally figured he had to be eliminated at that point. <br /><br />The biggest imbalance in this game was that DB underestimated the power of implied trust in a wolf-human mason pair. <br />Also even though guy could easily figure out I was a wolf, he wanted to keep me alive anyway, which makes him almost as bad as a wolf.

				I like the third party deal, i kept thinking that maybe i wasnt a wolf, i was never told i was a wolf i was told i knew you did it and id do anything to make sure no one knew lol, thats why i asked if we were on the same team because some of your PM&#039;s made it seem like you and guy were very close, also when i followed you the night you NK&#039;d eep guy was there in the text so it made sense that guy knew you were NK&#039;ing people which made me nervous. Then you killed me and it made more sense haha

				Narwhal NK&#039;ing you was the last thing I expected, but it was pretty funny. <br /><br />Too bad only the wolves had a good time :p They were overpowered with so few humans and the double-mason thing. C&#039;est la vie.<br /><br />Anyway I don&#039;t think IRC is really practical, I&#039;m sure Mystic can tell you why. Next game we should try to get at least 12 people though I think. Also it didn&#039;t help that this game was right around the holidays.
