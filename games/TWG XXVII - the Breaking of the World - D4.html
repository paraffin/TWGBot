They did it with an extraordinary loss of life - legends say they were powerful mystics. <br /><br />(http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/13538_1166974821115_1430250096_30427340_3748748_n.jpg) <br />Mystics whose knowledge of many things was supernaturally exceptional: the knowledge of offensive and defensive magics, the knowledge of war, and the knowledge of the future.<br /><br />They were eventually wiped out by a terrible unforeseen disease.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, before they died, they foresaw a terrible, worldwide cataclysm which would rend the Earth to its core. To assist in the prevention of this disaster, the culture put together a collection of artifacts and scattered it throughout the world. They prophesied that a (very brief) Age of Legends would arrive, where heroes would gather these artifacts and bring them together, and they left behind a calendar to mark the date.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, the calendars they left behind say the date is drawing near, and the expected heroes have been hard at work gathering together the necessary artifacts while the rest of the world thinks the date is a whole year in the future.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was revealed that a number of villains, the Dragonfriends, were expected to oppose this plan in their attempt to destroy the world. the Dragonfriends are shapeshifters who can take a wolf or human or dragonoid form. you, the Heroes of the Age of Legends, have stepped up to defeat these Dragonfriends and end the Rending of the World. <br /><br />you have several artifacts to help you in your quest:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Your abilities and fighting strength: Players will decide, as the blood-red sun sets each day, who they would like to kill. Whoever has the most votes is the intended victim. Barring special circumstances, that person will by lynched in the general melee. the High Priest demands a blood sacrifice every day or he fears the Earth will be destroyed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If there are still Dragonfriends alive after sunset, they can see in the dark and they&#039;re gonna whomp someone&#039;s heroic human ass (again barring special circumstances). <br /><br />If all the Dragonfriends are defeated, the world will NOT end. : )<br /><br />No vote limit<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Please put your lynch votes in <strong>bold</strong>.</span><br /><br />-the Iron Tablet of Heroes and Scum: <br />This tablet defines the expected players in this game. Attempts to change the writing on it do not work, and so the Wizard is convinced that the information about each player is fairly accurate, though it does not give any information about how exactly to identify these heroes and villains, or even how many of them are supposed to be present (some may not be player characters - they thought they were called to be office workers. Oops.).<br /><br />Metagame information: you will know the in-game names of some potential roles. Thus, roleplaying or dressing up as a character may be seen as a claim, but there will be none of that nonsense about &quot;maybe guessing that the vanilla bean is a human.&quot;<br /><br /><br />-the Iron Vault of Legends :(http://www.batuhijauschool.org/Asmat/studentpages/shaza/Social%20studies/Aztec%20pictures/aztek1.jpg)<br />At the start of each day, details will become available on an Item of Power. <br />At hottest part of each day, a cell of the Vault of Legends will open and an Item of Power will become available.<br />in the hands of a hero, the Item will assist to turn the tides when both alignments are evenly matched.<br />in the hands of the right hero, the Item may even grant a huge advantage. If the villains get their talons on it, however, it could be devastating. <br />When an Item is grasped by a player, it forms a powerful bond with that character and cannot leave the player&#039;s hands.<br /><br />Both sides (including nonplayer characters) have opportunities to gain Items outside of the Vault, so knowledge of the location of Items is never actually helpful in determining alignment, since the total number of Items is unknown. <br />However, getting the items in the hands of humans does increase the chances of lynching a wolf in the event of a tie. <br />Because of this chaos, it may be in the best interest of the wolves or the players to avoid a tie.<br /><br />Metagame clarification: <br />in the event of a tie lynch vote, the number of Items of Power in the hands of the humans is compared to the number in the hands of Dragonfriends. <br />you have no idea of how many items each alignment has.<br />If one of the potential lynch candidates is of the alignment that has less Items, that character will be lynched above the other tied characters. If this case does not apply, Quetzlcoatl forbid we must move to a secret coin flip.<br />Therefore, no information about alignment should be explicitly revealed by the resolution of a tie, but your actions will have an effect on the tie. <br />If no votes are received, the Vault turns and no one gets the item. This is a valid strategy, but remember that players can vote for themselves.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Please put your vote for the receiver of the Item in <em>italics.</em></span><br /><br />-Your wits:<br />the game should be winnable regardless of roles.

				As you gather around the site of the battlefield headed by the temple, the Vault gives a massive click and a whir, and a grinding of stone on stone comes forth. <br /><br />FIRST ITEM:<br />Synthesuit Mail – This treasure is a webbing of blazing rubbery cording woven together into a chain suit. It has exoskeletal components which look like they will increase the strength and durability of whoever wears it.<br /><br /><br /><br />PS: Sorry PM&#039;s took so long. Internet malfunction.<br />Any questions? <br /><br />Remember to put votes for treasures in <em>italics</em> and lynchvotes in <strong>bold.</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>DAY 1 BEGIN</strong>

				i was also considering the possibility of voting for ben<br /><br />the only reason i could think that he&#039;d so soon vote a majority for such an item is if he had some deeper knowledge about dieter than the rest of us. the same could potentially be said of haplo.<br /><br />&nbsp;i will stay my vote at this time, until more is revealed

				i was just about to say that, trientalis. i think that there has been a lot of metagaming going on thus far, that is, basing opinions based on previous scenarios. as someone who hasn&#039;t played since the single digits of the twg series, such speculations are only a foolish distraction from the game at hand, which most likely has nothing to do with the others at all, nor should they, crediting iron&#039;s ability to run games properly.<br /><br />furthermore, i think it would be pretty foolish to lynch someone whom popular vote just granted an item. i rather think ben just made a silly mistake that set the tide against him from the get go, but <strong>eep</strong> is the one who gets my vote for now, as his walls of text contain little evidence of logic, and it seems like he&#039;s trying <em>really hard</em> to keep the heat off him

				If you want me to play like I did last game, where I said nothing, and just pounced on any opportunity to do something rather than being active, that is the way I can be. I am not quite sure what you want from me. I&#039;m fine with you trying to bring up cases, eep. the one thing that holds for me is that you seemed really skeptical of why I did not yet have any information on what anyone could be. Isn&#039;t that kind of the way things are in the beginning of a TWIG? Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				As Iron said, Don&#039;t post whhile driving matt.<br /><br />more to the point, I am sorry that this is the first I have checked of the game.<br /><br />Here is what I am thinking though.&nbsp; I am most suspicious of Trent and those that voted for her right now.&nbsp; Ben was suspicious to me as well until he changed his vote from himself.&nbsp; (all the item voting)<br /><br />the reason this is suspicious is that the majority of day 1 lynches are of humans mostly because of the way wolves can keep the votes so easily off of themselves by making a small bandwagon.&nbsp; the same philosophy could be used in reverse for this item vote where they give the item to the first of their kind who got a stray vote from anyone.<br /><br />Still, I agree with AJ that we should not just lynch the player who just recieved the first item, which is why I am placing my vote upon <strong>enigmatic</strong> because he was the last one to the party

It seems to me that the hate started because ben voted for Dieter to have the item, if thats not it, then what is it? <br />Also @eep, pretty much the same question, but i mostly want to hear from you, you said earlier you didn&#039;t see a correlation between Ben and Dieter, so if its not because Ben voted Dieter, why are you voting for Ben? I can&#039;t find the post you said this in because my shit at work is messed up.<br /><br />Finally, @That_Kid and @Dr. Agon<br />Do either of you have some sort of gaming site linked in your signature or something? If so could you remove it? At work I can only see pages 2 and 4, pages 1,3 and 5 are blocked due to gaming. you two didn&#039;t post on page 2 and 4 and so I think that might be the reason its blocked.

				i think eep has been behaving relatively human - or at least, she hasn&#039;t been acting as clearly wolfish as she has in previous games (where i pegged her pretty reliably), so i&#039;d put her at 90%.<br /><br />don&#039;t have a good read on anybody else yet. i&#039;m not convinced haplo is a wolf either, i think he&#039;s just being jeremy.

				I don&#039;t like that we are ganging up on Ben right now, but I don&#039;t think he is a bad choice.&nbsp; I just really don&#039;t see him as a good lynch either.&nbsp; AJ seems to be trying to stay active without putting too much information forth, which is slightly suspicious.<br /><br />that said, I wouldn&#039;t even consider trying to lynch Guy or Eep day 1 because there is little change of a day 1 human loss and you know that they bring a lot of information which can only help.<br /><br />I still consider the item voting to be the best leas so far and thus my vote stays.

				the initial bandwagon for ben came after he tried to get dieter the first item without any reason as to why dieter should have it other than &quot;he always dies&quot; (which is the metagame point i made earlier). pretty good strategy to subtly make a move right off the get go&nbsp; before anyone would take serious note of it. additionally, dieter has been very silent, which as you yourself (eep) said is unusual (also a metagame but whatevs). the fact of the matter is we had more of a case on ben than we did on enigmatic, and now haplo, who also suspected ben (though not to the degree i did) and later eep (whose action undeniably saved ben) is now dead. <br /><br />seems like a small group of people is related in someway, which in a game where nobody should know what anyone else is doing (unless its openly stated) is high cause for suspicion

				I&#039;m sorry if my reasoning seems weird or whatever. I have yet to get used to the way that you guys play this game. Please keep in mind it is my second game that I have played. I was thought to be a wolf right away because I guess I was cautious, that confused me a lot and then I got defensive, which apparently is a wolf trait to you guys as well. in my opinion, I thought that the point of this game was to stay alive and to keep suspicions away from you. Maybe you are tuning in more to my inexperience? What exactly strikes you to believe that I am a wolf, guy? Any specific examples and why from anyone? <br /><br />Also I realize now that people cannot reveal who they are as characters. My apologies for trying a new thing on here. <br /><br />the item that I received basically welded itself to me and it has conversations with me.&nbsp; It seems to find digital watches as awesome. So, overall I have not gotten any good data from it.

				Now that I think about it my theory would revolve around Ben also being a wolf and yohu making a tie would KNOWINGLY save him because a wolf (trent) had the only item.<br /><br />I find snipe voting, even for a tie to be exceptionally suspicious.&nbsp; especially since items break ties.<br /><br />still, I find it unlikely that I would have been able to spot 3 wolves so far in the game, especially since I&#039;m still trying to decide if there are likely 2 or 3 wolves.&nbsp; This combined with the fact that <strong><del>eep</del></strong> has responded fairly well to my claims leads me to believe that she is human....for now.

Trientalis - could be newbie human or a wolf, but one part of something she did is consistent with something about my item that makes me lean human.<br />2. That_kid - actually does strike me as human through and through, unless his wolf buddies are dr.agon and guy or trientalis.<br />3. Guy - does actually strike me as legitimately presenting reasoning about aj/that_kid based on the thinking that he is human. I don&#039;t know for sure that this means he is human, though.<br />4. Eep - that&#039;s me<br />6. Dieter - no idea<br />7. AJ - i still think he&#039;s wolfy. I can&#039;t quite put my finger on why, but something about the way that he&#039;s been part-wishy-washy and part-just-agreeing-with-other-people doesn&#039;t quite sit well with me. Plus the fact that he wanted to rely on haplo&#039;s death as a reason why I was suspicious.<br />8. Dr. Agon - actually strikes me as human<br />10. Ben - i lean human with him, but guy does bring up a fair point about the fact that he needs to not lay low. However, he also did not get very upset about being the lynch candidate, among other things.

				I&#039;m going to throw a question out there that I remembered wondering when I read one of eeps posts.&nbsp; Do you guys think Enig was a human or a wolf?&nbsp; he sniped the item vote, which I would consider wolfish, but died on the tie.&nbsp; this leads me to believe that he was around 50% wolf if Trent is human and 100% human if trent is a wolf.<br /><br />Eep responded well when I questioned her earlier and seems to believe trents story due to the item so I am willing to bet that he may have, in fact, been a wolf.<br /><br />I am still going to look for partnering, but maybe that is the wrong thing to look for right now.<br /><br />It seeems statistically likely for us to have gotten a good shot off day one if this scenario is true.&nbsp; I would like to hear what you all have to say about this possibility

				I didn&#039;t just decide to agree with you eep. I put my reasoning for voting AJ a few pages back. <br /><br />It really would be nice to get some more opinions out here. I don&#039;t want to just vote for one of the inactives simply for the fact that they are inactive, although they are not helping much in this game. When they don&#039;t talk at all it is really hard to tell if they are human or wolf. Out of the people who are inactive I believe that ben seems the most suspicious because of doing nothing but jumping in every once in a while for an item vote. <br /><br />the only reason that I would doubt my AJ vote is that guy is feeling strongly that AJ is human. I&#039;m starting to feel like guy may be human but I&#039;m thinking about 65% human right now.<br /><br />For now I&#039;m going to be keeping my vote where it is.

				I was gonna say Ben always seems to stay out of conversations in games (cause he&#039;s normally dead? I was gonna read up on the meta but don&#039;t have time) but that&#039;s a good point about how he&#039;s only been voting for items.<br /><br />My original suspicion was on Aj as I felt his logic for Eep was very rushed and panicked. This came off as very wolfy as it seemed like a spur of the moment plan to try and gain a powerful position in this game and prove himself as a human. His plan kinda backfired but Guy still called him out as a human. <br /><br />I&#039;m still suspicious of Aj, but with what has been said about Ben I feel that he could be a more powerful enemy due to his interactiveness. I will vote for <strong>Ben</strong> but will still stay suspicious of Aj.

				well, it looks like <strong>ben</strong> is going to die. i hardly see the point in adamantly keeping my solitary vote on eep for today. and also because he&#039;s been driving me crazy, wolf or not.<br /><br />upon looking back, it does look like i rushed into my vote for eep. the thing is my vote was backed considerably from events of the previous day, and also because i was trying to get some sort of faction situation going, so i could observe what subtle alliances might unfold. the point is i wanted to make everyone choose a side, because in doing so a lot lot could be revealed.<br /><br />obviously i wasn&#039;t really so successful in this, but at least i tried something.

				So, this is a meta, but regarding that_kid, I feel like he&#039;s much more diligent about addressing all claims regarding him when he is a wolf, and that&#039;s precisely why I tend to find him suspicious as a human.<br /><br />Plus, most of what he has been doing seems to be geared towards making the other players trust him more, which is fundamentally something that wolves benefit from. This is re: guy&#039;s reason for trusting him.<br /><br />Also, I find it odd that he made a comment about the wolves likely being good strategists, which is a good point, but once again seems more geared towards making some players trust him more.<br /><br />So with that being said, I&#039;m moving my vote to <strong>that_kid</strong>

My __s_ription just said oh cool now they&#039;re working.<br /><br />Anyways, my PM just calls me a civilian, and doesn&#039;t say anything about a special item that only works for me.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to especially push for this, but if we really wanted to test this, we could try giving me another item to see if the other item *doesn&#039;t* work. This would be relevant to determining whether roles are pre-determined but just &quot;hidden&quot; from us beforehand, or actually given by any item.<br /><br />Just thoughts. There&#039;s also the possibility that our item votes are not fundamentally item votes, but votes related to actions per our hidden roles; except that no one item-voted for haplo d1, so at the very least, wolves do not operate under that mechanism.<br /><br />incidentally, my role is not a night action-submitting one, so I would not have special insight into this.

				I think we can reasonably assume from our new quest that there are two wolves alive, meaning that we have failed to lynch any wolves thus far (assuming 2 wolves out of 10 players, which may be false, considering the plethora of roles and items).<br /><br />This would result in the following allegiances:<br /><br />1. Trientalis - 45% human - claims to be seer (more specifically, blind seer - does this insinuate her views could be backwards, e.g. AJ is human and eep is wolf?). She could also easily be a wolf claiming seer. There has been no counter-claim, which supports her argument. We have had 3 other players killed, but none hinted at being seer. Just not sure on her yet.<br />2. That_kid - 50% human - we need to investigate how he specifically knows which item he needs<br />3. Guy - 70% human - frustrated by lack of activity indicates to me that he is a human who wants to fucking win this game<br />4. Eep - 55% human - hasn&#039;t flagged me as very wolfish based on her initial posts, but I admittedly did not read them very closely up until the last few pages.<br /><del>5. Enigmatic</del> - lynched D1 - assume 100% human<br />6. Dieter - 100% human<br />7. AJ - 60% human - I&#039;d be okay lynching him now, but given his lack of activity and the general ease with which the votes have been piled on him, I am inclined to think that he&#039;s a human. Could easily be wrong, of course.<br />8. Dr. Agon - 45% human - haven&#039;t heard much from him recently, need to go re-read thread<br /><del>9. Haplo</del> - killed N1 - 100% human<br /><del>10. Ben</del> - lynched D2 - assume 100% human<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,880.msg33663.html#msg33663">Quote from: eep on December 18, 2011, 08:09:59 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Basically, all the things that make me suspicious could also feasibly be newbie player things<br /><br />aj has been kinda suspicious since d1 in a non-newbie sort of way<br /><br />so, yes, I just find it more likely that aj is a wolf.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So do you think Trientalis has any/much potential to be a wolf then?

				Ok, look at my actions. I first was going very strongly against eep. I thought for sure she was a wolf trying to push suspicions on someone else, specifically me. Then I got to pick the first person that I wanted to view. I viewed eep of course. I was told she was human. I stopped putting so much blame on her. Then AJ started acting very wolfishly by trying to put blame on eep, who I now knew was human, he came back all offended that eep had voted for him to be lynched and tried to get rid of her. Then I suspected him as a wolf. My suspicions were backed when I found out that he was a wolf. <br /><br />I&#039;m trying to tell you guys as much as I can because I&#039;m probably going to be night killed. I hope this helps.

				the point I&#039;m trying to say is that you are a blind seer, which may very easily be a &quot;false seer&quot; (one that views the opposite of true alignment, which would mean you viewed wolf eep as human and human AJ as wolf).<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that is the case, but I think it&#039;s worth considering, especially given the plethora of roles we have.

				But, as Deiter points out, my character is the blind seer. Does that make it so that I can&#039;t really tell who is who? I have no idea. To me the description made it sound like I indeed knew what is going on with the creatures of the night. But it is true that I don&#039;t usually get too much more information than wolf or human. I don&#039;t get to know what role that the person is playing or anything. <br /><br />This is all that we know about the role I play:<br />Elytra wears bright blue contact lenses in the daytime to hide her milky, unseeing eyes. Her throwing daggers are razor sharp, however, as are her other senses. She has a Second Sight in combination with incredible hearing, and thus can often detect what the creatures of the night are doing.<br /><br />you guys can judge either way. I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;ve mislead anyone. It certainly was not what I wanted to do.

				trientalis, whatever role it is you have, it definitely isn&#039;t seer. i assure you that your view of me as a wolf reflects the opposite of reality, though whether that is because you are in fact a false seer or actually a lying wolf i&#039;m not yet 100% sure. it seems to me all too convenient how you use your lack of experience with the game to coddle others into trusting you; wolves always look best in sheep&#039;s clothing.

				i just told you she&#039;s not the seer. i am 100% sure of that, because i know that i am for a fact human. you have just as much reason to believe my claim to humanity as you do her claim of seer. as no counterclaims have arisen i assume she is indeed false seer, as would be suggested by the title &quot;blind seer.&quot; but really, you have my word against hers at this point. i just feel that it would be awfully easy for a wolf to scan the roles listed at the beginning and impersonate one. the fact that this particular wolf didn&#039;t know what a false seer was resulted in the convenient fabrication of a seer who can only see whether someone is &quot;human&quot; or &quot;wolf&quot;. as a wolf, trientalis would already know who all the humans were, and so could easily claim to have viewed any given person while pointing her finger at anyone she wanted.

				So I caught up to find out a lot has happened.&nbsp; the most upsetting of which is that I have discovered that the item I needed is now in dieter&#039;s possession.<br /><br />I now will not gain a role, but I do have some useful information that may clear up this mess a bit.<br /><br />the Anvil of Truth would have given me the ability to view, once a day, during the day, the role of a player and announce it aloud, revealing the truth.&nbsp; this would have made it impossible to hide the fact that I was a seer, but made the truth be fully heard as the GM would have said it rather than me, the player.<br /><br />Because of this I am....hesitant to believe Trents claim to seer.&nbsp; although it makes sense, I&#039;m not sure we would have two seer powers.&nbsp; However, AJ seemed really suspicious to me, until today.<br /><br />I am going to be the first to disagree and vote <strong>trientallis</strong>&nbsp; I still believe it is possible that she doesn&#039;t know she is false seer though and eep is the real wolf.&nbsp; I hope to god that isn&#039;t right because I will kill Iron for that.

His armor has disappeared, and his skin is burned wherever the armor touched - hands grilled by gauntlets, torso baked by breastplate, feet sunburned by sabatons. a layer of ash hid him from you at first. <br />&quot;Dragonfire...&quot; mumbles the High Priest and the Wizard at the same time.<br /><br /><strong>eep</strong> is dead. <br /><br /><br />the Vault of Iron excitedly flips to its next item - a glossy black circlet.<br /><br />the Crown of Obisidian – Shiny and black, with jewels worked in and a single large, clear crystal as the centerpiece. Crafted of the first drops of cooling magma from a bygone volcano. One size fits all.

				I cannot fathom why the wolves would confirm Trientalis as seer by killing eep. I was expecting them to make us doubt Trientalis is actually seer. Now, however, it is clear that <strong>Dr.Agon</strong> must die. <br /><br />Guy, my item appears essentially useless to me. There was fluff about making throwing daggers, but they don&#039;t actually do anything for me. <br /><br />I have a good feeling Trientalis won&#039;t die tonight, though.

				&quot;To whom shall we give the Item?&quot; everyone wonders.

				Actually guys, if we believe Trientalis is the true seer, then she has viewed a) AJ as a wolf and b) Dr. Agon as a wolf. That means Dr. Agon is most likely the last wolf if she is truly human.<br /><br />But consider a different scenario where Trientalis and either guy or that_kid are the last two wolves, who have succeeded in &quot;confirming&quot; Trientalis as seer by nightkilling an actual human (eep) that Trientalis &quot;saw&quot;. All they have to do is lynch one more human and they win.<br /><br />But we have 5 players left alive, so maybe our best bet is to kill a different player today than Dr. Agon, since if he&#039;s the last wolf, we can still kill him tomorrow when we have 3 players left. But if there are still two wolves that are not Dr. Agon, we have to try and kill one of those today, or else we lose. So perhaps we should consider lynching guy, that_kid, or even potentially trientalis today, see what happens at night, and either lynch Dr. Agon or a different player.

				so assuming 2 wolves in the entire game, there are two cases we need to watch out for:<br /><br />1) trientalis is seer, we have killed 1 wolf (AJ) and will kill the 2nd (Dr. Agon) either today or the next day<br /><br />2) trientalis is a wolf claiming seer, with most likely one other wolf still alive helping to push the vote on Dr. Agon and quickly end the game in their favor.<br /><br />plus, this is just starting to seem all too convenient:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,880.msg33725.html#msg33725">Quote from: Trientalis on December 19, 2011, 09:52:20 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I discovered that <strong>Dr. Agon</strong> is a dragonwolf. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dr. Agon was also talking at some length about what the Anvil of Truth does, and I do need to spend more time looking at it, but he does seem to know quite a bit about the item that I doubt any random player could know or learn.

				Well, there are only 5 players left in the game. I&#039;m really hoping that Dr. Agon is the last wolf.&nbsp; Based on my seer abilities, we already have gotten rid of one wolf, AJ. So hopefully this will be the last day.

				I appologize for my inactivity here, I have been as active as possible with the schedule I am given.<br /><br />Due to this I have now missed 3 total items witho9ut getting a chance to even cast a vote.&nbsp; This upsets me greatly.&nbsp; there is no reason that a phase should go by in less than a day Iron.<br /><br />in response to things said yesterday, Eep and Dieter both wanted to know why I had neglected to vote for myself to get the item.&nbsp; the reason is simple.&nbsp; I had not been able to get online in time to even see that that was the item that I needed.<br /><br />Another question I would raise is this, what would I have to gain from counter-claiming seer if I was a wolf?&nbsp; in this scenario I would be essentially guaranteeing that my alleged partner would be one lynch, I would be another, and trent would be another.&nbsp; There is no way for me to match 1-1 wolf to human ratio.<br /><br />in response to the voting habits, AJ voted for his only hope to survive through the day yesterday, which makes sense human or wolf.<br /><br />@That_kid, this scenario and the scenario last time I was seer are different entirely.&nbsp; for one, at the time you were the final wolf, and the only player not to claim a role.&nbsp; in addition you were in danger of being lynched and losing the game.&nbsp; I was never at risk of being lynched.&nbsp; consider that my claim of seer was simply that, I did not and do not believe Trent to be seer because I was seer.<br /><br />Dieter Is raising good points trying to save the game, however I believe he is attacking the wrong person.&nbsp; I would say it is safest to lynch Trent today for fear that she has a wolf partner alive and is close to winning.<br /><br />I would also like to point out that eep being night killed does not in any way confirm Trent as seer.&nbsp; It seems like a ploy to make me the next lynch so that she and her partner can win this day.<br /><br />I am okay with dying, but not this day.&nbsp; my proposition is this:&nbsp; We lynch Trent, That_kid vig kills me.&nbsp; one of us is guaranteed a wolf.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t die then we know that That_kid is the other wolf, or just a horrible liar.&nbsp; This leaves the humans with a win in the scenario that I am a wolf and another day in the scenario that Trent is a wolf.<br /><br />Dieter, I don&#039;t care who you guard.&nbsp; also, Dieter, you are the only one who is confirmed human at this point to me, because if you were a wolf and trent&#039;s partner, you would just vote for me and end the game.<br /><br /><strong>Trientallis</strong>

				That_kid, remember that last time you had waited to counter-claim seer and I even suggested myself as a lynch candidate over Iron because it meant a greater human win chance.&nbsp; I am making the same request this time.&nbsp; lynch Trent today and tomorrow we can see who is alive and make a lynch choice then.<br /><br />to debunk your &quot;all heroes have abilities to begin with&quot; statement I would produce the following argument as well.&nbsp; you are basing this off of two other players, one of which doesn&#039;t want to lynch me and believe my story because I had information about the item that he possesses and claims is correct, and the other is a possible wolf.&nbsp; This does not seem to be a smart move.<br /><br />the final statement I want to make is this: I know that delaying my death wouldn&#039;t help us win as an extra phase to make the same choice is pointless, except the added element of the items help us overcome these.&nbsp; I find it highly likely that the next item will grant you your vig power back.

				i don&#039;t like this<br /><br />based on the fact that there have been 3 human roles that have the potential to get even more powerful and that the likelihood of humans receiving weapons is greater than that of wolves, it doesn&#039;t make sense to have only two generic wolves<br /><br />so logically there are either more than two wolves or the wolves have abilities too<br /><br />because dr.agon wants to lynch trientalis, there is no way that she was made wolf (assuming dr.agon is wolf)<br /><br />all this being said, i feel like the most believable scenario is that trientalis is actually seer and therefore we should go with dr.agon

				also, since that_kid claimed to have targeted dieter before dieter confirmed that he guarded himself, there is little to no chance that_kid is lying. the only other explanation is that they are both wolves, but if that were the case it wouldn&#039;t matter to dieter that the vote is switched. they could win simply by going with dr.agon<br /><br />this suggests that dieter also must be telling the truth. either that, or he has some power as a wolf that negates human aux attacks against him<br /><br />if dieter is telling the truth, then that means that out of the five of us left, logically dr.agon is the only wolf left (as i am human and dr.agon is going after trientalis). i am afraid, however, that dieter is a wolf with an ability, as this does not seem outside the realm of possibility<br /><br />still, i think dr.agon is the best choice right now

				because:<br /><br />why would your role be different than others?<br /><br />why did you disbelieve her when she claimed seer? it doesn&#039;t make sense for the game to only have your role as seer, as it is severely limited, so it only really made sense for you to at least keep her around in the event that she actually is telling the truth (unless of course you were wolf)<br /><br />all of trientalis&#039;s posts throughout the game and her ideas and beliefs regarding the game support her views. that&#039;s how i knew exactly who she viewed and as what. that seems like a bit too elaborate of a lie, especially for a new player

Synthesuit Mail – This symbiote suit can let a villager mimic a hero’s item use. For example, a villager using this mail in conjunction with the Bow of Fire and Rain would be able to use the Bow for kills.<br /><br />you put on the Synthesuit Mail. you feel a slight shiver as it burrows into your flesh, connecting to vital areas and reinforcing them. <br />you gain no new powers, but you do gain a new friend: an ancient mystic personality is embedded within the Mail, and it chats happily (but vaguely) with you about the state of the world, about the heroes on the Tablet (apparently he is the preincarnation of one of those heroes; he won&#039;t say which), and how impressive digital watches are.<br />the personality refuses to answer your questions and in fact does not seem to have a very good awareness of what has passed.<br /><br />2. Pipe of Ages – This pipe allows anyone to channel Boris Worm, giving them the ability to break ties in item votes. <br />you snatch the Pipe of Ages from the Vault. As you test out its sound, you feel a tingling in your ear. you hear the legendary voice of Boris Worm, Dragon Expert and Bard, Gleeman extraordinaire! He thrills you with a flow of rapid buzzwords - sounds like the kind of guy who&#039;d talk anyone&#039;s ear off.<br />Boris gifts you with just a taste of his power to lead and persuade - from now on, ties relating to itemvotes will be settled by you. Whoever you voted for, if among the tied characters, will automatically receive the item (so the GM will no longer be making a coinflip). At any time, you may shoot the GM a private message about whom you urge the crowd to select for item ownership. <br />-Your vote breaks itemvote ties in favor of someone who&#039;s received your vote<br />-you can tell Iron ahead of time who should win in the case of ties, if you like.<br /><br />3. Anvil of Truth – This allows Dr. Agon or Haplo special privilege. It confirms Haplo as human by granting him the Sword of the True Hero or allows Dr. Agon to see a role – but Dr. Agon must reveal his view. <br />the Anvil feels light and warm under your arm, but doesn&#039;t change you noticeably. you test it out, make a few simple throwing daggers, drop it on a few mice and an unlucky roadrunner, but don&#039;t see anything magical other than the convenient weight. <br />you also feel the oddest urge to stand on it, posing boldly in the sight of everyone, but the villagers all just assume that&#039;s something heroes do<br /><br />4. the Crown of Obsidian – Replaces the Mark. Grants the wolves an extra teammate only if placed on a civilian.<br />you place the Crown on your head. you immediately scream silently within yourself. Someone is trying to get]into your head, to rearrange things, to alter vital situations in your life that have defined who you are. Your heroic will proves too much for the intruding presence, however - the memories of the battles you&#039;ve fought and the people you&#039;ve saved in righteousness are too positive for the lurking entity wriggling its way into your brain&#039;s crevices. Your fantastic willpower chops at those tendrils, severing them.<br /><br />Nothing has changed. you are still Elytra, the blind Seer, enemy of the Dragonfriends. you&#039;ve gained some inner strength from this encounter, though, and people will probably see you as a stronger and more ruthless person now. <br />Shuriken of the Constellations – enables Eep to be a Gemini Twin (Mason) with Haplo or enables any wolf to be a false mason. <br />Bow of Fire and Rain - was coming up soon, haha. you guys didn&#039;t need it.<br />Miracle Herb - a much later item for if the game was taking a long time<br /></div></div><br /><br /><br />the HEROES - <br /><div class="spoiler"><div class="spoilerheader"><input type="button" class="spoilerbutton" value="Spoiler" onclick="n = this.parentNode.parentNode.lastChild;if(n.style.display == 'none') {n.style.display = 'block';} else {n.style.display = 'none';} return false;"/> (click to show/hide)</div><div class="spoilerbody" style="display: none">1.

And PM me with any questions.<br /><br />2. That_Kid: you are Valeria, the Rogue Mistress. <br />Your character is not detailed on the Iron Tablet.<br />Valeria, the Rogue Mistress – Valeria has thrown off the strictures of society. Dressed in dark greens and blues (black doesn’t blend in as well as you might think) she stalks the night and day alike as it pleases her.

ONE time during the course of the entire game, you may send me a PM with the name of the player you would like to kill. That player will be killed during the night.<br />If you can get your hands on the Bow of Fire and Rain, you will be granted an extra kill.<br /><br />3. Guy: you are a Civilian.

				I was pretty happy with activity levels, for the most part.<br /><br />Dr. Agon is right in that the Items contribute to inconvenient day/night cycle qualities. There&#039;s probably some way to set them up more carefully, but he is the only one impacted by it lol.<br /><br />N0: Both sides start out with (1d3-1) items in the hands of NPCs. By luck, this is 2 per side.<br /><br />D1: Item given to Trienalis, who can&#039;t use it. I put this item early so that civilians would have a chance to have minor/fat chance powers early on, since personally I think civ is boring. It will prove crucial in a tie later on, though.<br />Lynch: tied by eep between Enig.Matic and Ben. This tie is broken by Trientalis&#039; item. Throughout the whole game, no one even imagines that Enig might have been a wolf.<br /><br />N1: Wolves kill Haplo, I&#039;m not sure why, though it&#039;s not a bad decision as a confirmed human would have been a big deal in the endgame. Dieter guards himself.<br /><br />Trientalis views eep, who she&#039;s been sparring with. This really worked out well in her favor I think, it seems people used the turnaround as evidence for her.<br /><br />D2: the only coinflip of the game, which ironically is for an item which removes coinflips entirely. Eep gets the item, which does exactly what it says.<br />Lynch Ben for inactivity. <br /><br />N2: Wolves go for Dieter, who is guarding himself. Every night he asks me if it&#039;s legal for him to guard himself. Most of the guardians in previous games can (though not all) and his PM explicitly says he can, so I laugh at this because his self-guard was successful twice (vs vig and vs wolves). a bit of confusion in the day over why there was no kill; Dieter takes his time about revealing it was him and not the bulletproof (although he wouldn&#039;t know he was targeted).<br /><br />Trientalis views AJ, who is a wolf.<br /><br />D3: Dieter given item, though he doesn&#039;t want it, I assume people are using their instinctive strategy to vote for less active players. <br /><br />Quests handed out to humans and wolves. <br />Dieter notes that this shows two wolves are alive. This is invalid, as quests were set up ahead of time and unknown numbers of NPC items were to be expected, with only the role the wolves need to kill left unrolled, but this is still a good point and something to keep an eye out for. I&#039;ll look at future possibilities more critically. I suspect a few of these subtle things got skipped in reading the massive original post, since Dr. Agon also suggests using ties to filter wolves during lynch. <br /><br />Lynch AJ on Tri&#039;s say-so. Dr. Agon and AJ kinda throw their lots together, while I thought AJ&#039;s arguments sounded weak. Then again, I knew he was a wolf so I guess it is just awesome to be God. the wolves were really relying on AJ, because he grants them an extra kill tonight if he lives.<br /><br />N3: For some reason I absolutely cannot understand, Dr. Agon kills eep and confirms Tri, which allows her to out him next day. I&#039;m guessing reverse psychology? Hard to say if this had any effect or not.<br /><br />That_kid is trying to decide on a kill. He trains his bow on AJ during the day.Then Dr. Agon, then Guy. Now back to Dieter. He&#039;s on a forum.<br /><br />Finally goes with Dieter, which wastes his kill. I don&#039;t send any sort of confirming messages because I wanted it to be unknown explicitly what happened during the night, but I guess I should have sent SOMETHING, because I have to answer questions about whether he still has a kill left.<br /><br />D4: Item not given much consideration. This Item could have really changed things, as it&#039;s a Mark. I don&#039;t think the wolves know about it, though, which kind of weakens their position.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really understand Dieter&#039;s argument against voting for Dr. Agon, but again I know he&#039;s a wolf so I&#039;m probably just am play gods. Not enough votes leave Dr. Agon, though, and the game is won.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Humans won by luck and because the dragons collectively were some of the least available players. Too bad; I would&#039;ve liked to check the balance. <br />I gave a value to each role (based on some googling and some fiat based on my game) and kept a running pivot table; humans were ahead for a long time since no one power role can equal even the weakest wolf and a wolf was killed first day.

				the game was pretty good, I was just too inactive.<br /><br />What would have made this game far more interesting would have been if I was active when that item came up and my story was confirmed and didn&#039;t sound like some shit story to save AJ.&nbsp; I would also like to point out that had AJ not been capable of gaining multiple nightkills I would have just voted for him anyways and never revealed my role.<br /><br />It would have been interesting if I had viewed Trent and had to reveal that she was seer tough.

				I can&#039;t play this game if the vote end time is at midnight - that&#039;s 4 hours where communication spikes and people can just backdoor like mad.<br /><br />Additionally, the whole game was way too meta in the beginning for my tastes. Ima step out of the TWG ring for awhile til I rage less.

				That was a fun game. I feel like I didn&#039;t play as well as I could have.<br /><br />Also I&#039;d like to give congrats to Dr. Agon as his wolf plan was really good. you almost had me believe you when you first came out. If you wouldn&#039;t have said anything about killing&nbsp; Trientalis I probably would have believed you.
