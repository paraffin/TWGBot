				Deep in the forest of Citsym the village of Draob has survived in peace and tranquility for centuries.&nbsp; Something has gone wrong though.&nbsp; Nobody quite knows why (maybe they realized that centuries of inbreeding doesn&#039;t make a strong village in the long run) but some of the villagers have become crazed murderers! to make matters worse, they seem to only do it at night when everyone is asleep so nobody knows who the murderers are.&nbsp; Your only clue is that you see wolf prints going toward the mangled body, but human prints walking away.&nbsp; maybe it is a supernatural compulsion that leads to the murders, either way you have determined that joining together and killing one person a day is the best coarse of action.&nbsp; just like any sane community would.<br /><br />Players<br /><br />1. Trient<br />2. Modi<br />3. Iron<br />4. Guy<br />5. Epplant<br />6. AngryNarwhal<br />7. Death_butts<br />8. Phil<br />9. Dietcar<br /><br />I will be sending out PMs now so post in here to confirm that you got them.&nbsp; everyone can change their vote as much as they want, but can only be voting for one person at a time.&nbsp; in the case of a tie, all parties will be put up to a runoff vote, where each living player can vote only once, if that is also a tie, all parties will be lynched.&nbsp; day will end wednesday night at midnight eastern time.&nbsp; If I am not present at the time of days end, no further votes will be counted.&nbsp; If a player does not vote they will be counted as having voted for themselves.&nbsp; No quoting PMs.&nbsp; No posting at night.&nbsp; typical TWG stuff other than that.

				Nah, Narwhal and Guy&#039;s natural antagonism might make it difficult to tell these days if they&#039;re on opposite teams or just arguing for the sake of it, but their arguments tend to be relevant, if nothing else, and that&#039;s not a bad thing to spare on the first day.<br /><br />On the other hand, picking through arguments for relevant details may not be the best use of our forty pages a day...

Then he just seemed to carelessly throw out that he was voting for Modi today. It seems slightly wolfish to me. But then again he is actually playing.

				I thought the time for talking was over.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to think of Iron&#039;s claim.

For example, it&#039;s not likely that the wolves know they&#039;re masons and are therefore gunning for them.

				also yeah <strong>iron</strong><br /><br />the reason you don&#039;t secret votes is BECAUSE you don&#039;t know what other people are voting. so the wolves (although so do masons) have an advantage because they can vote together, whereas humans cannot. so if there is one or even two wolves in the runoff, wolves get an even bigger advantage by being able to obviously not vote their partner. we also get no data from this. <br /><br />further, there are likely many humans who don&#039;t care, or who don&#039;t care out of two of the candidates, and so would vote randomly. but, they could really not want one of the three to die and they have no way of knowing if, for example, everyone else was voting between iron and guy and they wanted guy to survive, but the person voting didn&#039;t care if iron or dieter died as long as guy doesn&#039;t die, and they decide hell just vote dieter because they don&#039;t know most others are voting iron/guy and their vote is wasted<br /><br />it&#039;s just all around retarded and i don&#039;t see why you would do secret votes? having things remain secret benefits the wolves more than anyone else

				Yikes. Two lynchings? I definitely would have moved my vote would I have known that was going to happen.<br /><br />I guess if one or the other was a mason though, mason is not the worst role to loose. I do agree that it sounds like there are a lot of roles appearing, so if there are two masons and one or two wolves, that is 3-4 people already. Then it sounds like someone was claiming seer in some way so that puts the number of people that have roles to 4-5 so I guess there might be 4-5 people that are just villagers? I guess that is not too overwhelming.

				I voted guy. :/ I&#039;m not super happy about that decision, but I&#039;m fairly sure there aren&#039;t that many actual roles in this game, especially with guy knowing Death Butt&#039;s role, which suggests he&#039;s a role of some sort too.<br /><br />So my guess is one of the two groups (Iron + Dietcar or Guy + Death Butt) is a wolf. If not, that&#039;s probably all the roles, in which case we&#039;re not in a very good position, and I don&#039;t think everybody would have claimed unless they were certain that the other groups were wolves - the roles aren&#039;t mutually exclusive, so it seems odd that there were so many claims all at once. Protecting known roles is good, but only if you are certain that other claimants are wolves.<br /><br />Of course, the weird voting situation last night complicates it, since people that know roles are going to be very defensive of the roles they&#039;re sure of. Still, I don&#039;t believe that all four potential roles are human.<br /><br />At this point, though, I&#039;m not sure which group is which, and I&#039;m hesitant to put pressure on Death Butt and make him reveal his role.<br /><br />So at the moment I&#039;m going to see what we can get out of <strong>Dietcar</strong>, since he&#039;s already been revealed.

				So it seems like we have guardian or bulletproof or some other unfathomable role. <br /><br />I don&#039;t understand the nature of how guy and deathbutt trust each other. Obviously from my point of view as a mason, it seems unlikely they are also masons. So it seems fairly likely they are wolves or seer or something bizarre?

				I&#039;m going to vote for <strong>Phil</strong>. His quickness to disbelieve that there were masons could either be a cautious human behavior or a sly wolf behavior.

Also, if dietcar and Iron were wolf partners, that is a pretty dumb mistake they made with one protecting the other so much, so that is what leads me to believe that they were masons in some way, and not wolves.

That&#039;s not quite the same as wanting you to claim (though by now the wolves know you&#039;re SOMETHING, assuming you&#039;re not a wolf yourself). The bigger risk of claiming is claiming to be any role, not claiming to be a specific role, especially in a fairly sparsely populated game such as this. I trust people with roles to make decisions about when and how much to reveal, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s always unreasonable for a human to try to get some extra evidence out of someone who is already known to (most likely) be a role.<br /><br />As a side note, there&#039;s also been relatively little attention given to Trientalis, Phil, and myself, though I suppose we were eclipsed by what amounted to a quadruple-claim.

				Ye gods, another claim.<br /><br />This is a lot of claims. For now, I&#039;m assuming that they&#039;re not all true. So one of Guy and Iron was probably a wolf. There&#039;s probably only one wolf left at this point, but with all these roles there might even be two. <br /><br />If Iron was a wolf, then Dietcar is a wolf, which means that Phil probably isn&#039;t, despite his rather odd claim. Phil is the only one who voted for Dietcar last night, and me, Dieter, and Iron were the only people who voted for someone that wasn&#039;t on the Dieter-Iron team. In this situation, if there&#039;s two wolves, I&#039;d probably have to be the other one. This situation is consistent with Phil&#039;s claim, mildly inconsistent with me being human, and consistent with mason&#039;s being unlikely.<br /><br />If Guy was a wolf, then Death Butt is a wolf, which means that me, Dietcar, and Iron are among the least likely to be wolves. Phil and Trient could be wolves as well in this situation, if there&#039;s an extra wolf hanging around. This situation is inconsistent with Phil&#039;s claim, but consistent with all knowledge that I have, though inconsistent with mason&#039;s being unlikely.<br /><br />I almost find Phil&#039;s claim to be generally less likely than Masons. It&#039;s a weak role, easy for wolves to claim, and the game is small. I don&#039;t like relying too much on the &quot;the game is small, therefore&quot; stuff, but in this case I don&#039;t have enough evidence to vote anywhere but <strong>Phil</strong><br /><br />1. Trient - unknown<br />2. Modi - me<br />3. <del>Iron</del> - mason<br />4. <del>Guy</del> - role<br />5. <del>Epplant</del> - vanilla<br />6. <del>AngryNarwhal</del><br />7.
