				<em>Do you remember the days long past, the days when we could all be together without the bloodshed?</em><br /><br />Well, those days are over. Long gone. And the reason is so simple, so trivial, and yet can never be undone. the reason, my pretties, is that someone, <em>SOMEONE</em> put M&amp;Ms in my skittles.<br /><br />And not only that, they did it again. This is the second time some motherlackeys put their motherlacking M&amp;Ms in my beautiful bowl of skittles. They&#039;ve ruined it, and now there&#039;s no going back. the gloves are coming off. I&#039;m not playing TWG with any of you until you figure out who&#039;s done it and get rid of them.<br /><br />And as for you, little bowl of candies, I deeply hope you&#039;ll have cleaned yourselves up by the time I get done dealing with those assholes. Each and every one of them.<br /><br />Oh, but things are a little different this time, or haven&#039;t you heard? I <em>guarantee</em> the existence of at least one of the following role:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you are an ALCHEMIST!<br />Each night, you may target one player. That player will switch from a skittle to an M&amp;M, or from an M&amp;M to a skittle, depending on what they are to begin with. They will be informed of such, and might have feelings about that, except they are candies and cannot have feelings. Beautious! Gloriful!<br /><br />Shine bright my little sugar starlet~!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />the RULES (modified from Narwhal&#039;s rules)<br /><br />1. I am the rules. Rules may be modified at my discretion. I will make an announcement if the rules are modified.<br />2. Do not under any circumstances communicate with any player about the game outside of the game thread unless your PM explicitily states that you may do so. you may not &quot;quote&quot; PMs. <br />3. Do not post when alive unless it is day. Do not post when dead unless it is night. <br />4. Vote by putting a name in bold. you may change your vote unlimited times until the day ends. a vote not cast is a vote for yourself, which may end up creating or determining a tie.<br />5. Majority rules the lynch at day&#039;s end.<br />6. If you go an entire day (24 hours) without posting, you will start the next day with +1 votes on you. the weight of this vote will increase by 1 with every day you do not post.<br />7. Any questions or confusion should be directed to me privately. <br />8. Do not edit your posts for any reason. <br />9. the game ends when 100% of the living players are either skittles or M&amp;Ms.<br />10. you win if the remaining players have the same alignment as you.<br /><br />the PLAYERS<br />1.

				Yeagz&#039;s theory in general doesn&#039;t make any sense. Any GM that expects a player to determine their alignment based on the phrase &quot;shine bright my little starlet&quot; is not as good of a GM as eep. Why would anyone expect her to reveal the Alchemist&#039;s alignment in the rules anyway?<br /><br />So that being said, it seems like a weird attempt at feigning ignorance. I&#039;m marking down Yeagz as non-vanilla already. <br /><br />Cole, you seem to be implying that you DID get that in your PM, and that you also think it&#039;s an indicator of alignment?

				Actually, you know what? My big mistake in the last game was not giving humans enough chance for counterplay. So I will state outright: no two players start the game in contact with one another. Certain players on both sides know the identity of certain other players as of game start, but will not be updated as alignments change. Wolves do not know how many other wolves there are.

				Anyway. I am so far very pleased with eep&#039;s game. She&#039;s given us something to think about.<br /><br />We need to consider the mechanics we DO know about, and we need to ask ourselves: How do they affect our gameplay?<br />We are playing a game where not only do we have no idea what team our fellow players are on, but we&#039;re not entirely certain what team we are on, either. I am a skittle now, but I may not be at endgame. If I was an m&amp;m I would be asking myself, what happens if I am turned into a skittle? <br /><br />Overall at this point I can only advise extreme caution.

				Still need to hear from Dr.Agon, swoop, and adderall, right?&nbsp; Anyone want to remind them to get in here?<br /><br />As usual I have a million different ideas and no idea which ones I should say out loud.<br /><br />I will say this: a human alchemist&#039;s move is sort of twice as dangerous (for both sides) as a lynch.&nbsp; If they successfully target a wolf then the wolves lose a guy and the humans gain a guy.&nbsp; If they target wrong, the humans lose a guy and the wolves (only kind of?) gain a guy.&nbsp; So it seems to me that maybe the person generally consider to be the wolfiest *shouldn&#039;t* be lynched, they should be left to an alchemist.&nbsp; And the lynch should actually be the 2nd-wolfiest.&nbsp; Obviously this logic only works if there&#039;s a human alchemist which definitely isn&#039;t a certainty, but seems fairly likely to me.&nbsp; Just something to think about.

				asking questions like this is the best way to iron out whatever kinks might arise later because of the fact that a lot of the mechanics are new<br /><br />it decreases the chances eep will have to make a decision to change something later in the game. better to get them out now<br /><br /><br />also, i think it makes the most sense (especially after considering the things xazarus said in his most recent post) for the alchemist to be able to target themselves. i kind of also want it to be the case because it seems like the most fun

				I&#039;m not sure if this would help at all, but should we do something like an underlined vote just to kind of see who everyone thinks may be a good choice for the Alchemist to target? This is merely a suggestion, and the alchemist wouldn&#039;t even have to follow what the majority would vote for of course, but perhaps it could help with the whole count whoever is seen as most wolfy as the one we should convert and then lynch the second wolfiest person?

				my first thought when I read this was that alchemist changing themselves to the other team was the coolest thing I could imagine.&nbsp; then Guy went off and said it a million times already.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty excited for this game, it seems awesome.&nbsp; what alchemists need to do is target the players who started with knowledge about other people&#039;s alignment, so that the game can get super knowledgeable fast.&nbsp; I love this idea too.<br /><br />anyway, I think its going to be very difficult to attempt to control who the alchemist(s) target through public suggestion.<br /><br />I also think its dumb to even try to suggest that a mass claim of alignment is a good idea, it&#039;ll just make people lie, or later be wrong anyway.

				the 9 posts and 2 votes between me starting to write this and finishing fucked all my shit up, but I think it&#039;s good now<br /><br />If I&#039;m acting differently this game, it&#039;s because I actually have a vague plan I&#039;m trying to do.&nbsp; Last game I had no greater strategy because I didn&#039;t know what the hell I was doing, I was a powerless human, and some dude who definitely knew what he was doing was trying to kill me.&nbsp; There was nothing I could do, and not even any information I had to myself (once I told people about guy).&nbsp; I think I played last game as a powerless, useless, newbie human.&nbsp; And you&#039;re right that I&#039;m not playing this game like one.<br /><br />My only real suspicion at this point is yeagz, for exactly the same reason Iron suspects me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only played with yeagz once, so that&#039;s all I really have for comparison.&nbsp; But it seems to me like yeagz is playing <em>very</em> differently than he was last game.&nbsp; I think an implication of the skittles/M&amp;Ms theme is that there&#039;s &quot;no vanillas&quot;, at least based on the last skittles game.&nbsp; So if yeagz isn&#039;t acting like he did last game as a human role, then it seems likely he&#039;s a wolf role or a 3rd party.&nbsp; <strong>yeagz</strong><br /><br />Speaking of which: Unofficial vote count (quite possibly wrong given the complications of the voting system, but I wanted to have some idea what was going on)<br />I ordered by number of votes, then by number of &quot;real&quot; votes, then by the first vote to happen<br /><br />yeagz 2 (cole, Xaz)<br />trient 2 (self, inactivityx1)<br />Levet/Adderall 2 (self, inactivityx1)<br />Lymric 2 (self, inactivityx1)<br />guy 1 (DB)<br />Cole 1 (yeagz)<br />Xaz 1 (Iron)<br />Iron 1 (guy)<br />Dr.Agon,&nbsp; swoop, Narwhal 1 (self)<br />DB 0<br /><br />We&#039;re only a couple hours away from Adderall leading the vote by default&nbsp; :-\

				So I wrote most of this this morning when we were a few pages back but I didn&#039;t get time to post. Fortunately it still seems relevant<br /><br />Very interesting start so far.&nbsp; It sounds likely that there is more than one alchemist, but if that&#039;s the case then this game is going to get pretty crazy. I suppose it&#039;s good that such an important mechanic would have some redundancy but with two (possibly more, but I doubt it) people changing alignment each night, especially combined with whatever other roles there are...<br /><br />I don&#039;t think we should try to influence the alchemist too much, or at least, we shouldn&#039;t leave our biggest suspects to them. We can&#039;t just bet that there&#039;s a human alchemist who will listen to us and if we&#039;re wrong then we lose a human to the wolves instead of just killing them.<br /><br />One thing I&#039;m concerned about is if there are two alchemists, and they can switch their own alignment, what if they both decide that their odds are better on the wolf team? They will be shooting blind for the most part and they are more likely to switch a human for a wolf. in addition, since anyone they&#039;ve switched is more likely to now be a wolf, they&#039;ll be able to influence the wolf and human votes in that person&#039;s favor. Unfortunately there&#039;s not much we can do about that besides hope they don&#039;t agree with me that it&#039;s better.<br /><br />Other than that... <br /><br />While guy&#039;s questions about alchemy were quite pertinent, it&#039;s unusual for him to ask these things all at once like that. Not necessarily suspicious, but unusual.<br /><br />I think xas knows more about the previous skittles game than I remember. And his soft-claim is interesting. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think yeagz really revealed anything about himself when he asked about the sugar starlet line.

				an alchemist could always refrain.<br /><br />Just like a vig normally does. That&#039;s pretty much exactly how I see the role.<br />However, someone who is alchemizing a lot is perhaps more likely to be a wolf, so that is something to keep your eyes open for, if there&#039;s any way to tell (sudden swings, perhaps).

				I just though of something hilarious: a wolf could get night killed, especially towards the late game as identities become even more confused. That&#039;s awesome, hahahahaha!<br /><br />But the odds are in favor of a human getting NK&#039;ed, especially before the alchemists start working their magic.<br /><br />the main reason I want the alchemists dead is because the longer the game goes on, the more powerful they get. Each conversion becomes much more meaningful as our numbers dwindle.

				Yeagz, the thing you don&#039;t seem to consider about alchemists is that they are only dangerous if they decide to play it that way for some reason. It&#039;s not in their best interest to convert themselves, I am thinking, unless wolves seem to be pulling ahead - and if you know that, then you know who the wolves are, so they aren&#039;t pulling ahead!<br /><br />It&#039;s not in their best interest to use their powers at all unless they have very good suspicion of wolfiness.

				Im still on the fence about everything honestly, I feel like this game is going to get pretty wild, no while i know the wolves do not know who each other are, BUT is there a benefit to a skittle knowing who other skittles are? Im REALLY looking forward to see how N1 goes, if there are two alchemists and they both decide to switch someone then things will be very different D2, but we may not be aware just how different things really are&nbsp;

				for clarification, i&#039;m saying i disagree with iron and narwhal and don&#039;t disagree with levy tran raceteam<br /><br /><br />also i&#039;ve been thinking about possibility of seer and how they&#039;re kind of useless. announcing any view is as dangerous as it is kind of mostly unhelpful. any seer could easily be wolf, although i suppose an alchemist would be aware of that. but anyway, any view they make could easily be wrong as early as the next day, depending on what order the night actions take place in<br /><br />this is sort of interesting though and could be very beneficial if the alchemist(s) and seer decide to work together, but there&#039;d still be no way of knowing alignment of either person

				Alright, just got off duty so had to catch up on the last 24 hours<br /><br />I was saying previously, that since we know no 2 players are not in contact with eachother, a positive id on a skittle would become a prime target for the wolves so they don&#039;t hit eachother, if they can kill another wolf that is. So I was just saying that by claiming a vanilla skittle role you may as well be painting a target on yourself saying here. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t played with enough people to know anyones specific playstyles, but how I see day 1, people trying to get information or explain themselves might slip in the way they are wording it, that was why I was questioning yeagz earlier. <br /><br />

				also, there is absolutely zero reason to assume the wolves outnumber the humans<br /><br /><br />everyone is saying alchemist favors wolves, but that&#039;s not even necessarily true. wolves don&#039;t know each other and need to vote. it would not be unbalanced for there to be equal humans/wolves at start

				BOTH teams need 100%<br /><br />it would actually be unbalanced in favor of the humans to start with fewer wolves<br /><br />there&#039;s the increased chance wolves will kill each other or that they can be converted<br /><br /><br />so i think it makes sense to assume at least a definite larger number of wolves than usual

				ok i say this every game<br /><br /><br />generally one of the biggest advantages for the wolves is that they always know with certainty how close they are to winning, and the humans almost never know for sure<br /><br />in this game, they have no idea. it would futher cripple them unreasonably for this reason. it wouldn&#039;t make any sense for there to be only 2 or 3 wolves, and i&#039;d suggest there are probably more than 4<br /><br />but literally no person in this game knows how many wolves there are<br /><br /><br /><br />this leads to the hilarious possibility of wolf massclaiming being a good idea for them. if not now, then definitely as the game progresses<br /><br />this is one of those games where you really have to stop thinking about it the way you think about twg and evaluate the way you traditionally think about everything<br /><br />

				lol all over the place how<br /><br />and like if so, how is that abnormal<br /><br />but anyway, it&#039;s frustrating that you guys see that questioning as a problem. seriously what the fuck. i was trying to get as much information from the host as possible about the game<br /><br />do i normally do this? probably not. but it&#039;s not because it&#039;s abnormal behavior for me. it&#039;s because this game is different. it&#039;s not like other twgs. we have to think about it outside the scope of that<br /><br />so, because of that, additional information about the layout and mechanics is useful and i can&#039;t fathom thinking otherwise. and besides, as i&#039;ve already pointed out, eep already changed something because of it

				I am not all over you about the questioning, but I am for you claiming to know more about this game than me.&nbsp; I actually applaud and stated earlier that if I had been present I would have asked many of those questions myself.<br /><br />in any case, I was and still am hoping to get more information out of you by putting pressure like this because by your own words as xasarus helped point out, you were not giving everything you knew.&nbsp; are you afraid of who might target you if you said more?&nbsp; you have back-peddled into saying you don&#039;t know more now, but I&#039;m not sure which I shouldn&#039;t believe, the not kowing more or that you CHOOSE not to elaborate.&nbsp; or even if any of it was true.

				What&#039;s confusing to me is that ill I&#039;ve done is point out something that is obvious that wolves could use as a example of not supplying information to a group who don&#039;t know who the others are. That&#039;s suspicious ? <br /><br />I think guy is the only one here trying to iron out the understanding of the rules and information we have , I think by him elaborating on himself would make him a target . And agon of he revealed he has a ability or rule that might allude to third parties or show he&#039;s a skittle that would make another Eastwolf choice . I think you shouldn&#039;t just say people are suspicious for trying to progress our game knowledge

				Okay, ive read the forum, and as of now I see no reason to vote for guy. He&#039;s always a little unconventional, and is usually the most helpful player we have. the thing that sucks about this game is lynching no one is a good idea at first, but also lynching anyone and everyone is a good idea because everyone is everyone. so that&#039;s weird. <br /><br />I still haven&#039;t decided who to vote on, but I definitely see no reason to lynch guy yet.

				For the record, I&#039;m not really for lynching guy.&nbsp; Clearly he&#039;s being evasive and lying just a little bit, but it seems generally well-intentioned.&nbsp; He wanted everybody to be aware that there&#039;s 3rd parties and play accordingly without revealing too much about himself.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s fair, I just think he maybe should have gone about it differently.&nbsp; Because obviously information about yourself <em>is</em> information about the game.

				I have no idea what Swoop&#039;s getting at, unless he&#039;s just implying super heavily that he&#039;s the orange skittle?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why?<br /><br />Anyway, I wanna get some shit started while we still have time to talk it over.&nbsp; This may be a dumbass move, but I think it will help the Skittles enough that it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; Even if I die, I think it puts the Skittles in a solid enough position that I&#039;m alright<br /><br />I was alchemized last night.&nbsp; I was an M&amp;M yesterday, and today I&#039;m a Skittle.&nbsp; in my initial role PM, I was informed that Death Butt is the purple M&amp;M and Cole is the Green M&amp;M.&nbsp; Unless there&#039;s two alchemists working for the same side (Or a wolf-leaning alchemist fucked up), they are both still M&amp;Ms.<br /><br />I think the way DB completely flew under the radar, while Cole was widely suspected, indicates that DB&#039;s a much more successful wolf and needs to be stopped.&nbsp; Based on the role/color combinations in the previous game, I&#039;m guessing that DB is an un-linker and Cole is a Seer, but I have no confirmation of that.&nbsp; a Seer isn&#039;t that useful of a power unless you have someone to tell about what you saw.&nbsp; So I&#039;m guessing Cole&#039;s not that dangerous as a wolf but he might be useful as a human.<br /><br />So I&#039;m voting <strong>Death Butt</strong> <span class="bbc_u">Cole</span>.&nbsp; I just hope I can convince enough people so I can survive this, or at least not die in vain.

				Hey folks.<br /><br />I was a human, if you&#039;ll believe it.<br /><br />I was human alchemist. I am indeed a purple skittle, though there is also another color I am associated with.<br /><br />Guy is telling the truth about us being connected. I was connected to him As I Lay Dying. I do not know his alignment.<br /><br />I asked eep, and it is possible for alchemists to change their own alignment. Or for me, at least. I&#039;m still a skittle though. I was planning to change myself to see what happened, then report back, but I died first. I cannot confirm if my color and powers would remain, though I sorta assume so.<br />&nbsp;<br />Alchemists are also allowed to abstain.<br /><br />I was not third party. <br /><br />I did not alchemize xazarus. That means either wolfchemist messed up or xaz is lying.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />I have no information about duplicate roles and colors. I wouldn&#039;t read too much into them though, for the same reason as any attempted confirmation. Maybe they&#039;re ok for day 1 and 2.<br />On the other hand I think tracing spies is a good strategy.<br /><strong>I think humans might have a backup alchemist.</strong><br />Death butt has supposedly been outed. It would be a cool wolf strategy to alchemize him and expect another alchemist to do the same, like WIFOM. Keep this in mind if another alchemist should be evidenced.<br />If it were me I would lynch DB tomorrow. Lymric seems OK but that&#039;s not proof.<br />Keep an eye on xaz too though. He&#039;d be a good target for a wolf alchemist again. Perhaps he should be lynched next.<br /><br /><br /><br />I will be able to talk every night so leave me some questions. Keep in mind that wolves will likely be able to view my answers before submitting their actions.

				Alchemists can&#039;t target themselves when they are dead, so I assume they can&#039;t target other dead folk.<br />Alchemy seems to happen after the nightkill, as my own current alignment testifies.

That could explain a conversion to human.<br />-Does yeagz&#039; ascension have any impact on alignment? It didn&#039;t in the narwhal party when a similar thing happened.<br />-Yeagz mentioned that he wants the alchemists dead. Then an alchemist died in the night and yeagz came back to life.<br />-Yeagz claimed &quot;my death isn&#039;t a big deal&quot; and is now resurrected. He also hard-claimed vanilla.

				Okay guys.<br /><br />Lymric and Iron and xazarus were all right. I was a purple M&amp;M alchemist and on N1 I fucked up and turned xazarus.<br /><br />Last night I alchemized myself. Sorry wolves, but y&#039;all are on the losing end of this one.<br /><br />As a wolf I learned some things. Levetiracetam is the red M&amp;M linker and started with info on myself and trientalis. She linked up with me on the first night but our communications were severed last night. I&#039;m sure the unlinker can confirm that bit. <br /><br />When I claimed, I actually thought that Dr Agon was the purple skittle, probably alchemist like myself. He is probably an M&amp;M after all. After Lymric&#039;s claim, I was able to figure out the rest of the colors and alignments based on this symmetrical color wheel sort of pattern. Humans, this is why it&#039;s maybe better to not give out all your information at once!<br /><br />red - Lymric, levetiracetam - linker, info on orange, purple<br />orange - guy, trient - seer<br />yellow - swoop, Dr Agon - unknown, info on orange, green<br />green - yeagz, cole - unknown (undead?)<br />blue - narwhal - xazarus - unknown, info on green, purple<br />purple - Iron, death butt - alchemist<br /><br />So, there are three wolves left and I&#039;m okay with lynching any of them. I&#039;ll turn the player of your choice tonight and then we only have one left.<br /><br />I feel like a dick for betraying my teammates, seeing as how I&#039;m the one responsible for xazarus and the subsequent poorly thought-out claim that compromised Dr Agon. But this is the only way I could think of to win, and that&#039;s what I&#039;m supposed to try to do.<br /><br />Honestly I think this game is biased against the wolves. Half the wolves start out with info on others and if they get alchemized at any point then shit like xazarus&#039;s claim will happen. Similar thing if someone like me learns more about their teammates. On top of that, it&#039;s next to impossible to fake claim. you can&#039;t pick one of the roles where two other people know about you because then you&#039;ll have three humans counter claiming. If you pick one of the others, you have to know practically everything about that person&#039;s spot (color, role, who they know about) in order to be convincing about it. If dead people couldn&#039;t talk you could at least hope they didn&#039;t claim everything before they died, but instead every claim is going to be challenged, and probably with more convincing/true information. Levet and I were the only ones who could have pieced together enough information to even try to fake claim but even then some of that info came at a price, and it&#039;s still incomplete.

				soooo, Iron and Deathbutt claim they are purple and alchemists, and deathbutt now claims to be converted as well.&nbsp; what is interesting about this is that they are as likely humans converted to wolves as they are wolves converted to human.&nbsp; I trusted deathbutt because he had knowledge about my color, but it is obvious that there is still an alchemist out there.&nbsp; Maybe Iron is wolf alchemist and he lied about his power not working while he was dead?&nbsp; this seems like a good play if he can use his power at night.&nbsp; he lets everyone think he doesn&#039;t matter anymore except for information and then spews even more confusion into the game.

				Guy, I don&#039;t think we know enough about the resurrection mechanics to structure our lynch on it. Yeagz was lynched, Iron was NKed. We don&#039;t know if NK victims can come back. We don&#039;t know what happens when there are numerous dead people, or what happens when two guess correctly. We don&#039;t know if that&#039;s really just Yeagz&#039;s role. etc. etc. etc. <br /><br />That&#039;s not to say that DB is an entirely awful lynch candidate. you have points, but it&#039;s worth noting that without him, skittles just don&#039;t have an alchemist, period. the matter deserves further consideration, to say the least.

				Hence why I said &quot;resembles quoting a PM from me.&quot; I don&#039;t want to make any definite claim regarding whether he actually got that PM.<br /><br />I might give him a pass since he&#039;s a newer player and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s game-breaking, but for the record that&#039;s something we want to avoid.

				1.&nbsp; I began this game as a skittle and remain a skittle.<br /><br />2. I am not red.<br /><br />3. I am not a linker.<br /><br />4.

				nah i agree<br /><br /><br />in any case, blue powers are not really as scary to humans as they are to wolves, so i don&#039;t think putting blues on the backburner is a bad decision<br /><br />especially considering how dangerous purple and red are. conversion is very scary. and the ability to put wolves in communication is even more scary, i think<br /><br />i&#039;m not really sad lymric is dead because of this, but it does make me want to go for trient soon<br /><br />deathbutt is primary concern right now though regardless of his current alignment

				death butt (3) - xazarus, guy, yeagz<br /><br />If I wanted to be consistent, I would end the day at 6PM today. But, honestly, I&#039;m considering just ending the game, both because there have been work-related things coming up that have prevented me from performing basic hostly duties like vote counts, and because a lot of what could be cool in this game is getting eliminated way too soon.<br /><br />I think there&#039;s also a fair amount of stuff that I would need to rework in order to make this into a balanced game that doesn&#039;t become just a tedious push to win while fighting against various game mechanic obstacles. That&#039;s not really what twg is about and I don&#039;t want to see this game go down that path.<br /><br />If you guys really, really want to keep playing, then I can keep the game going, but I think it might be better to just shut this one down for now.

				It&#039;s really neat that there were special dead powers.<br /><br />However as I already expressed, I think there was just too much information available, to the point where everyone had both teams sorted properly by day two, and I just could not see any meaningful opportunity for counterplay.

				Yeah I think if I were to revise this game, I would definitely want to reduce the amount of information, and possibly even eliminate the obvious color-coding of roles. So a spattering of players would have information on one other player, rather than this tightly-woven network.

				the dead people powers were a cool idea, as were the living powers, I suppose. But yeah, as I and others have said, there was too much structure. I would definitely support totally eliminating color:role correspondence in a future iteration of this game.
