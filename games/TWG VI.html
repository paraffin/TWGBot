				Alright, alright:<br /><br />a tribe of Northern Tatars is known for its prowess in battle, and the fear it strikes in the heart of its enemies by the strange attire worn in combat: wolf skin. Now, war has been declared between the Tatars and the Turks, and the demand for wolf-skin armor is at a peak. a small taskforce of elite Tatar spies have donned their wolfen furs and infilitrated a nearby wolf pack, in hopes of killing and skinning all of them. the spies are well trained in the intricacies of Wolfenheimerbunbun, the ancient language of the wolves. the wolves must sniff out and eradicate the Tatar menace before it&#039;s too late.<br /><br />Basic Rules:<br />There are 2 teams, Tatars(wolves) and Wolves(humans).&nbsp; the object for either team is to eliminate the opposing team. Rounds are divided into nights and days.&nbsp; During the day, all players deliberate on who they think are Tatars and cast votes to kill.&nbsp; During the night, the Tatars decide on a target and are allowed to kill someone off. the Wolves win when all the Tatars are dead, and the Humans win when Tatars &gt;= Wolves.<br /><br />Other Rules:<br />-No talking at night (This means no posting in this thread until I say the day has started)<br />-No private messaging to another player, or outside discussion, meaning all discussion must happen publicly via posting. (Tatars are allowed to communicate to each other privately)<br />-you must post at least once per &#039;day&#039;, or you will automatically get a vote for yourself<br />-you may change your vote twice per &#039;day&#039;, meaning votes are permanent and cannot be changed once cast.<br />-the day will automatically end if one player receives a majority of votes<br />-Tatars and special roles must send their nighttime kills/guards/sights within a reasonable period of time, preferably less than 24 hours<br />-you may not copy/post any private messages from myself or other players into the game<br />-No posting if you are dead (absolutely no outside discusion of the game for reasons that may or may not become obvious through course of the game)<br />-All rules will be subject to my discretion<br /><br />Guaranteed Special Roles:<br />Hunter (seer) - a wolf role, allows the wolf to sniff out and identify the role of one player per night.<br /><br />Wolfmother (guardian) - a wolf role, allows the wolf to prevent a Tatar attack (a successful guard will result in a message akin to &quot;Nobody was killed last night.&quot;)<br /><br />Players:<br />1. Reaper<br />2. RandomizeR<br />3. guy<br />4. That_Kid<br />5. LiquidAngel<br />6. Lymric<br />7. Enig.Matic<br />8. Haplo<br />9. Ben<br />10. Dieter<br />11. Phil<br />

That&#039;s...that&#039;s all I&#039;ve got so far. Nobody&#039;s really said anything or claimed anything. I feel just about neutral on everybody else. Well, positive on Guy, I think, unless he still wants to kill me. Very slightly positive on Haplo. But he&#039;s also spent most of his time being confused about the theme, which = negative points.

Do you see me making seer claims? Unless a wolf (bad guy) can successfully claim a role and get away with it, he&#039;s better off not making any claim that will get easily disproven. Do you see anybody making easily disproven claims? I sure don&#039;t. I see a whole lot of nothing. I see whole of inactivity, I see a whole lot of lack of sleuthing, especially on your part. the one game where you were a werewolf, Guy, you were being overly helpful. This time, you are less helpful than usual.<br /><br />I mean, do you <em>really</em> think I would make such a terrible werewolf that gets lynched on the first/second day? Do you really think the werewolves aren&#039;t taking the back seat this time around? I don&#039;t see anybody trying to do anything. Inaction = failure.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with being angry. This game fails to live up to the hype.<br /><br />P.S. prone to killing? That&#039;s the whole point of the game: you find out who&#039;s bad, and you kill &#039;em. I&#039;ve tried to do some sleuthing, now&#039;s the time for threats. Something&#039;s got to give.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cleanse, purge, KILL!

				People are still on even with the server&#039;s issues. I mean, this day has been going for four days now, and likely five if it ends Sunday night. There have been posts from most people, it&#039;s just that they don&#039;t contain anything. There&#039;s still the opportunity.<br /><br />What I&#039;m saying is that the werewolves <em>are</em> lying low - this is evident because nobody&#039;s posting anything. If nobody&#039;s posting anything, and there are werewolves present, then it follows that the werewolves are also posting nothing. It feels like this game is between you and me.

				Ok, let me start off by apoligizing for being inactive recently. I have somewhat lost interest in this game. Now on to business.<br /><br />Haplo coming out as seer D2 probably wasn&#039;t the best idea and according to your story, could have been avoided had you not been so aggressive and just hung back and waited. This could have been easily done, which to me seems a little off.&nbsp; Acting a certain way and saying that they can tell what role you have based on how you&#039;ve acted so you need to come out seems like a poor excuse.

However, that could have easily been devised ahead of time, too. And I don&#039;t feel like that excuses coming out on D2.<br /><br />Still don&#039;t believe him, but we could still give him another day. On the off chance that he is sorceror, he might be able to find our real seer, which would be a tragedy. But I think that&#039;s a reasonable risk, no?

				I don&#039;t feel that Dieter is werewolf, he has been acting basically the same(wanting people to be more active and willing to stick his neck out there to rile things up a bit). Guy, I&#039;m not so sure of, but getting rid of him would mean one less contributing member. Haplo is being a dumbass human, or a wolf attempting to trick us. And Lymric has been rather inactive, but I feel that getting rid of him for that reason alone is foolish, as there are better choices. I guess I&#039;ll go with <strong>Haplo</strong>, I suck at this game and managed to not come out as seer on D2, mainly because that&#039;s only one view, not very much proof.

I&#039;m still going to vote for him, as I know whats going on. <br /><br />I thought Randomizer was the other tatar. Due to the way guy protected him at the beginning. I was apparently wrong as they chose to kill him. I see no reason why if I were a wolf, saying this would help me.<br /><br />I will list reasons why you should believe me over guy one last time. First off, no one has counter-claimed my seer role. No one will, unless the other wolf is willing to make himself vulnerable. the role guy claimed is obviously doesn&#039;t fit with the theme. wolf Friar? WTF? From what I&#039;ve seen, wolf mother and Hunter, the theme seems to follow a wolf pack. a role named wolf Friar makes no sense. And he obviously lied about what lymric was. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry I was agressive and forced myself to come out because of it.

				the real seer may simply be dead, or hesitant about coming out.<br /><br />wolf friar, well, it does sound stupid. But we don&#039;t know the names of any other hidden roles, so it&#039;s kind of a moot point. <br /><br />I still find it unlikely that Lymric was a wolf, for some reason. But if he was, well, good. Lucky lynch.
