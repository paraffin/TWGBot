				<span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Mysticboards State Correctional Facility</span><br /><br />Welcome to Mysticboards State Correctional Facility, a supermax prison where no one escapes... unless you snitch, that is. Now, most of you are hard-ass gangsters who would kill a man for shit like that. <br /><br />But last night, <strong>Haplo</strong> was found dead in his cell (thank god). the snitches bashed his skull in or somethin’. Shit just got real. <br /><br />And they’ll come for each of you next. <br /><br />you’ve gotta find the snitches and slit their throats so that you can make it out of this place alive.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Prisoners</span><br /><del>1. guy</del> night 3<br /><del>2. eep</del> day 3<br />3. AJ <br /><del>4. iron</del> night 1<br /><del>5. dr. agon</del> night 2<br />6. mystic<br /><del>7. that_kid</del> day 2<br /><del>8. death butt</del> night 3<br /><del>9. liquidcraig</del> day 4<br /><del>10. AngryNarwhal</del> night 2<br /><del>11. enigmatic</del> day 1 <br /><br />Typical TWG rules apply. No outside PMs, no night talking, no death posts allowed (unless it’s really vengeful or hysterical). <br /><br /><strong>Let me know if you don&#039;t get an initial PM.</strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 2.65em;" class="bbc_size">If you can&#039;t read the Google Doc, here&#039;s a PDF</span>.

				realistically it comes down to who i don&#039;t want to kill, and here&#039;s a list and reasons<br /><br />Prisoners<br />1. guy- i want to play, not die<br />2. eep- very good player. good to have around. will at the very worst be an active wolf<br />3. AJ- as i said, last game not only gave up but was very inactive. in the past has been both a very good player and very active, so i&#039;m willing to not lynch<br />4. iron- typically active, which to me is the most important<br />5. dr. agon- last game gave up<br />6. mystic- same as eep<br />7. that_kid- same as iron<br />8. death butt- pretty new player to the boards, though seems very seasoned and not stupid. would rather not kill<br />9. liquidcraig- dick, though put in a shit ton of effort last game and pretty much played the whole wolf team<br />10. AngryNarwhal- first game, refuse to lynch day 1<br />11. enigmatic- gave up last game<br /><br />so really i have some sort of reason for not wanting to lynch each person. ideally i&#039;d want to not lynch anyone, but this is a correctional facility constructed by dieter&#039;s brain, so of course there&#039;s going to be fucked up shit like rapes and toilet paper mummies pooping in other peoples toilets at night and shit. what else is there to do in prison<br /><br />typically at the bottom would be dieter and haplo. haplo for above mentioned reasons and dieter because it&#039;s funny. but neither of those are possible at the moment

				I feel I should point out that last game I contributed as much as Iron did for the most part until the last day where it ended when I had two consecutive days of 12 hour work days and didn&#039;t go home afterwards.&nbsp; and I believe that I am normally a very active player but I will likely have the same experiences every weekend this game so if you want to lynch me for that matt, feel free.

				guy while what you&#039;re saying makes sense in concept, i don&#039;t really agree with your assessment of the players involved. If enig.matic had just given up, then humans wouldn&#039;t have won that game. i guess you could say that aj gave up but for the most part he had a legitimate excuse not to be around. and I don&#039;t see how dr.agon gave up.<br /><br />Basically the vibe I get is that you are trying to go for the same sort of thing as that game where you were seer and haplo vigged you, except you seem less justified in your accusations. Which makes me think that you&#039;re just trying to be a ballsy wolf.

				I just dislike when people use past games to draw conclusions about a current game. For one thing, that makes it very easy for players to trick everyone based on what you say, simply by doing the opposite. Another thing is that each game plays out differently.

				usually it would just be mildly annoying <br /><br />but as i&#039;m browsing at work i don&#039;t exactly like the word Dongs in large bold text filling my screen (and even though i&#039;m sure any possible readers wouldn&#039;t know what it means it still looks more than anything like i&#039;m not working)<br /><br />also i don&#039;t think it&#039;s that important for you to make the word dongs easier to read

				So can I go ahead and vote <strong>extend day</strong>? We&#039;ve finally got some people talking that other people wanted to start talking. <br /><br />I&#039;m not changing my vote at the moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m letting my Liquid thing go because everyone is doing it. There is still something about talking about your OWN meta that seems weird to me but it&#039;s unavoidable in this situation, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Nothing about Iron strikes me as really suspicious. He hasn&#039;t said a lot, but as a Kindle owner, I buy his excuse. His thing about the day ending sounded to me like &quot;I don&#039;t wanna be a dick and demand I get my way.&quot; Eep just kind of throws around votes willy nilly IMO. His guy vote seems like a &quot;hey I&#039;m not lurking.&quot;<br /><br />Enigmatic&#039;s latest post doesn&#039;t make me feel stronger about him, but it doesn&#039;t do anything to relieve my concerns either. I do sympathize with his gripes about D1 though. His evaluation of the guy/mystic combo is incorrect. Why is he so quick to dismiss it with anti-logic?

				I learned to like D1 in XXXII. <br /><br />Enig putting &quot;dongs&quot; in big letters and writing it off as practical is goofy, but despite my vote on guy being a vaguely joking post, that combo (especially after guy brought it up) is more likely a wolf-thing rather than merely a week poster.<br /><br />As for meta, this isn&#039;t a roleplaying game (unfortunately, haha). There are no poker faces here so it&#039;s all about reading words, and I don&#039;t know why meta is such a four letter word around here. Eventually there will be better data, yeah, but really getting votes flowing is the only way to do that D1. (that&#039;s half of what guy is saying when he says eep is a good player, I think - she is strong at starting up the flow of info). <br /><br /><br />i&#039;m always paranoid about everything. i&#039;m also paranoid about being seen as paranoid, because that happened one game (i was human too haha). <br /><br />No one would have thought it was a big deal, no one was likely to call me a dick, yet it&#039;s important for all the humans to look at all these possibilities.

				also &quot;the day should never be extended on the say-so of just one person&quot; is bullshit because first, everybody wants more information, except maybe wolves, and second somebody has to be the first to suggest it<br /><br />one person asking for it doesn&#039;t mean dieter will grant it, which is what this seems to imply<br /><br />additionally, there&#039;s no reason to be hesitant about it because nobody is going to assume you&#039;re a wolf trying to save a partner because as i said, everyone wants information<br /><br />this is just too suspicious. <strong>iron</strong><br /><br />there have been roleplaying situations in the past. mostly in TWGII and ribos last game. they mostly just made the game more fun<br />

I also dislike aj jumping to a bandwagon on enig.matic after iron got up to 2 votes. So, I find the following scenarios most probable:<br /><br />(1) If iron is a wolf, then aj is also a wolf.

Furthermore, if guy is a wolf, then one of (enig.matic, mystic) is likely to be a wolf.<br /><br />AngryNarwhal&#039;s defense of iron likely falls under one of the following categories:<br />(1) Defending iron because he knows him personally, and some people just tend to play that way whether they realize it or not.<br />(2) Defending iron because he is a wolf and some wolves just like to defend humans to gain their trust.<br /><br />Will read through the entire game and make a list of thoughts on players soon.<br /><br />also this was ninja&#039;d but enh

				Additionally, with longer days there is more information that comes out but that&#039;s both good for humans and wolves. Plus, this gives wolves more time to plan actions (if they even do that.) However, shorter days mean that votes are more kneejerk and made on the fly / more likely to be made illogically or based on falsities (see: claiming when you aren&#039;t)

				liquidangel and enig.matic have not voted, the others have.<br /><br />so to get back to more metagame stuffs, I have heard the claim that if a bandwagon forms on a human player, the third person on said bandwagon is almost always a wolf. would be interested if someone else felt like doing some analysis in that regard. Notably, however, aj has held that honor twice this game.<br /><br />Also, to answer an earlier question: aj it wasn&#039;t that you were ever voting for iron, but here was the situation:<br /><br />enig.matic has 2 votes on him (angrynarwhal, dr.agon)<br />guy has 3 votes on him. (aj, eep, iron)<br />iron has one vote on him. (death butt) (cemetary butt?) (also they look like zits so i am confused are you saying that zits are like the gravestones for germs or something)<br /><br />I move my vote from guy to iron.<br /><br />enig has 2 votes<br />guy has 2 votes<br />iron has 2 votes.<br /><br />aj moves his vote from guy to enig.<br /><br />enig has 3 votes<br />guy has 1 vote<br />iron has 2 votes<br /><br />Thereby breaking a 3-way tie.

				i think we have some good candidates on the vote count and it is really cool that we have lots of patterns. its not cool that most of these pages are mistakes. i am going to assume they were honest ones.<br /><br />there are a few layers of thinking i find believable. one is the obvious layer of who is saving who. lynch controller is however approaching total chaos - so complex as to be random and proof against even the most careful analysis.<br /><br />on d1 perhaps simple is better.<br /><br />the final believable layer is red herring vote trails. i suspect we have at least one. cant really surmise those until computer access. bound to be a few possibilities and a few impossibilities.<br /><br />i like how after all that fuss enig still doesnt know why his probabilities are wrong.

Additionally, we take the pool of 11 which would be the 1st wolf, and multiply that by the second wolf and since a person can&#039;t be wolf twice, that leaves us with 10. Of course you&#039;ll get dual pairs in the fact of a+b and b+a so it is eventually 2/110 or 1/55. Like I said, I&#039;m probably wrong - I fail mathematics on a regular basis.

				More reasoning:<br /><br />I feel fairly confident that enigmatic is NOT a vanilla human. His playing has just been too strange. <br />Assuming he&#039;s a human with a power, the wolves would know he is a human, and hopefully other people are feeling the same way I am about him not being vanilla. That makes him a target for the wolves. What makes him a good lynch target is that he might be easy to start a bandwagon on since all other suspicious people have already been bandwagoned and then dropped. in addition to that, I&#039;ve been setting enigmatic up for a bandwagon all game, so if he gets lynched but ends up somehow becoming confirmed human, people will say &quot;Who wanted to get enig lynched? Oh yeah. AngryNarwhal.&quot; And suspicion will fall where the wolves want it again, on a human. <br /><br />TL;DR enigmatic is the perfect wolf lynch target, that_kid gives no other reason for vote. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I was trying to get your input because last game the reason I chose to kill you was because your analysis was almost exact on D1. This time. however, you strayed quite far.<br /><br />I&#039;m not feeling <strong>eep</strong> at all this game. It feels like she is playing differently than she usually does, and I can;t quite put my finger on it. That was just the vibe I was getting during the last couple of pages I speed read through. I don&#039;t understand the AJ hate. He is acting almost exactly as he did the game where I had to choose between him and eep. (in which case eep was the wolf). I am having a lot of trouble believing that AJ is a wolf right now.<br /><br />the main players I am suspicious of are:<br />eep<br />guy<br />angry<br />deathbutt<br /><br />eep for reasons stated above.<br />guy because fuck him jokes everywhere. That is almost exactly what he does as a wolf.<br />angry because you seem to try and push things in incorrect direction (this could just be because your&#039;e new). you also immediately jumped to hard advocating extending the day right after guy said it makes people seem human, and this was a tactic I used last game to look human as a wolf.<br />deathbutt because last game you seemed to jump to much better conclusions than you are this game, and you aren&#039;t going as hard with the theories. Voting for someone because they seem &quot;useless&quot; on day way just seems uncharacteristic after what you pulled day 1 last game.<br /><br />Also, fuck all you, I always &quot;metagame&quot; because the majority of this game is knowing how to read players and understanding their behavior. the best way to do that is to use previous games as a baseline. This is also undoubtedly the best way to get information out of day 1. Just watching the other players. Unfortunately, I had to skim a decent amount of posts because the fuck were you guys doing last night.<br /><br />Luckily, it seems we are having a very good D1 though.

I don&#039;t want to vote for the same person as that_kid<br /><br /><br />@eep: please note, I am not accusing that_kid of lurking. At the pace we&#039;ve been going, it&#039;s not surprising not everyone can keep up, and I have seen TK post a fair amount, with content. I&#039;m just pointing out that he didn&#039;t vote until page 17. And I still think we&#039;re misunderstanding each other, I never said you were lurking. I was talking about Iron at that point.

He doesn&#039;t normally get heavy into the discussion unless he has a role, thus reason 2. Like I had said earlier I am more for voting <strong>aj</strong> but I didn&#039;t because eep. Then eep switched her vote over to him and I felt that there was no need to change my vote as enig was in no real danger and aj had one of the highest vote counts. But if it makes you feel better I&#039;ve changed my vote to where I really wanted it to go.<br /><br />I like retorting to votes on me :)

				If there is enough suspicion on enig from day 1. I&#039;m guessing there is a decent amount because he has been voted for a lot the wolves probably wouldn&#039;t kill him in hopes of being able to lynch him later. I also don&#039;t like how you&#039;re making an attempt to pre-counter arguments that may be made against you days from now, and using those as justifications for what you are doing. you seem like you are trying too hard to preserve the fact that no one will be able to prove you are a wolf based on your actions.

				Because you fuckers post so fast.<br /><br />To eep:<br /><br />No, I&#039;m pretty sure what I meant was you seem like you did in the game where you were a wolf and AJ was human. I meant that sort of different. I will admit though that I forgot that you were a sorcerer last game. I also found your vote for AJ quite odd as a lot of other people did. you are now switching again to guy which is more reasonable to me, but it almost feels like you&#039;re trying to back peddle from before.

				I didn&#039;t forget about iron. I listed him as third out of four suspicions waaaay back when. Eep has very much overtaken him.

				But why is guy focusing on iron all of the sudden? His latest vote is for him but can we view that as anything serious? Guy seems to just be throwing around the bandwagon, trying to see how much influence he has on it. He asks people to vote for him, people vote for him. He pushes iron, people are back to iron. are we letting him be the puppetmaster? I really have no clue what role he is, but if I had to guess based on the little&nbsp; I know of his personality, I&#039;d still say he&#039;s vanilla, shitting his pants with laughter about how he&#039;s handling us. <br /><br />Annoying, but also admirable.

				okay i&#039;ve thought about it and the risk the wolves would have to take is too great in targeting aj<br /><br />basically best case scenario there are two which are<br />1. they kill a human then he shoots a human<br />2. they kill him and he doesn&#039;t shoot a wolf and isn&#039;t confirmed<br /><br />worst case scenario:<br />they target him and are blocked, the presence of a guardian is pretty likely, and he shoots a wolf and is confirmed <br /><br />so aj i suggest saving your shot until day2 at least when we have more info and you therefore have better accuracy<br />

				Man I can&#039;t tell what&#039;s going on with eep, but her soft claim is enough to push me in the direction of <strong>Iron</strong> at this point, who at the very least is not likely to be a power role. My best guess for her actions is that she&#039;s trying to stir shit up so she can see who uses the chaos opportunistically, which is what I read from &quot;i trust my own ability to handle chaos more than i trust most other people&#039;s&quot;. <br /><br />Plus a claimant is on the Iron wagon, so that&#039;s the wagon I&#039;d rather be on. Not being on a wagon is just pussyfooting at this point.<br /><br />I&#039;m disappointed that LiquidAngle hasn&#039;t faced more pressure today, but there&#039;s always tomorrow.<br /><br />AngryNarwahl, it&#039;s good you brought up how Guy is kinda getting his way a lot, but I don&#039;t know what that means yet and Iron just makes sense to me now.

				mkay so here is a really quick guide to how i&#039;ve been working this game<br /><br />a LOT of the votes i cast are joke/random votes, especially when I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on. I look at the way people respond and votes pile up after that, and depending on the trends I decide my final votes.<br /><br />When Iron cast his first vote for guy, I thought things were pretty clear. But then guy did pretty much the same thing right back at iron, and things got confusing for me. So, I reverted back into random vote mode and jumped on everything I found even a little bit suspicious (or mildly humorous).<br /><br />anyways, i am concerned about angrynarwhal&#039;s acknowledgement that i could be a power looking for a target, mixed in with the fact that he&#039;s apparently more willing to lynch me than iron. My question to aj was rhetorical, not actually looking for an answer, because damn have his voting patterns been strange this game.

				Worst case scenario eep is actually a wolf trying to fish out power roles and Iron is vanilla human (as he hasn&#039;t claimed).<br /><br />Iron not having claimed is an interesting situation. On one hand it suggests he&#039;s vanilla human waiting to be our virgin sacrifice. On the other, it could be him being too paranoid or careful or worried to come right out with a fake claim, or just counting on his buddy to save his skin here.<br /><br />Narwhale, I was referring to this:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36544.html#msg36544">Quote from: eep on July 12, 2012, 10:26:28 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> i don&#039;t consider myself expendable this game.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ninja&#039;d, but this post has a linky :)

				eep i see what you&#039;re getting at with the &#039;what am i&#039;, but that_kid is right in that we already have guardian and vig-something claim. Aside from seer the only &#039;standard&#039; role left is masons and who the fuck would come out with that now.<br /><br />mystic I agree. Evidence right now is nothing more than judging other&#039;s quality of play, meaning effectively zilch. Claims get a free pass for tonight as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />Does enig.matic have an excuse for his recent absence?

				i really don&#039;t mind lynching vig anyway. they can ruin the game and their most common case scenario is that they give the wolves a bonus nightkill.<br /><br />out of all the claims i feel like trust it&#039;s dr.agon. it&#039;s like 50% but that&#039;s more than anyone else.

				Ok, if I say my proof to potentially disprove AJ, I will die. Immediately (or as soon as Dieter reads the message). I will be thrown into solitary. Which, at the pace this game is going, I&#039;d probably be much more useful using my role that way than what my actual power is. Dieter might get mad at me for doing it though because the clause was meant to keep me from coming out, not to be used to confirm me (in my own demise).

				okay guys, my power is over now.<br /><br />I had no control over when it went off, but the reason I did not believe AJ was that the first person (wolf, seer, guardian, whoever) that attempted to interact with me during the night I would kill.&nbsp; I went berserk on Iron last night when he tried to guard me.&nbsp; my guess is that the wolves either targeted myself and the guard worked somehow (I was told that a night kill would not work on me if I killed the snitch trying to kill me) or they were targeting Iron and I already got him.<br /><br />I was trying to set up a false guardian claim day one to make the wolves target me and then allow myself to get lynched the next day when I explain that it was a wolf that was dead and not a human, but when AJ claimed I feared a seer or guardian being viged by me without my control thus &quot;confirming&quot; his claim when there was nothing I could do about it.<br /><br />this didn&#039;t go well at all.<br /><br />I am suspicious of eeps claim, but I still think AJ is full of shit.&nbsp; no way vig and my shit is in this game.

				on the other side of things, at least my power didn&#039;t cause the wolves to get a free extra kill of a power role, which was what I was super fearful of when I read it as Iron most likely targeted anyways.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind if you guys want to lynch me because I no longer have any way of proving myself, but if eep is indeed telling the truth we are on track for a win.&nbsp; if not, than so be it.<br /><br />I saw that coming out with my role to prevent AJ from being falsely confirmed if he was a lying wolf as worth my life and the only option last night.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry that it turned out this way, but I am also glad that we didn&#039;t get screwed with them killing Iron and me killing the seer.<br /><br />eep, I don&#039;t believe you because there is no way to confirm you (true for me too now though) and I find it unlikely that was got a wolf yesterday when I still think that AJ is probably a lying wolf snitch and the only options for a lynch yesterday can&#039;t both have been wolves unless goddam are we good at this.<br /><br />I was trying to become a night target BTW<br /><br />it would be great to try and set this up so that we lynch me today, eep sees if I was human or not, or a seer confirms this.&nbsp; if I am a wolf by eeps view, great! the game is probably over.&nbsp; if I am a human and there isn&#039;t an extra kill than we know AJ is a wolf.&nbsp; if eep is NK than we know she was telling the truth and that I was probably a human and should lynch AJ.<br /><br />the fear here is that AJ&#039;s thing doesn&#039;t work and he is human and eep is a wolf we get two human lynches in a row.

				haha that is almost exactly what i expected would be dr.agon&#039;s role<br /><br />actually i wasn&#039;t thinking kill but i was thinking priest role, that is, anyone who does something to him would be revealed<br /><br />still, that fact isn&#039;t confirmed<br /><br />anyway, game is close to over if everyone is telling to truth<br /><br />of course, i don&#039;t think every single person with a claim is telling the truth.

				I dunno if today or last night was more confusing... All I know is holy shit so many claims.<br /><br />If enig really was a wolf, then Dr Agon or that_kid was the other, largely following eep&#039;s reasoning and recognizing that no fucking way was there a tie between the two wolves on D1.<br /><br />If Dr Agon is telling the truth, Iron really was guardian and really did guard Dr Agon and the wolves very sensibly targeted Iron. Dr Agon got the kill though, because obviously the guardian&#039;s action happens before the wolf kill.<br /><br />Iron wasn&#039;t a wolf because if he were, then Dr Agon is lying, which means he&#039;s a wolf too and not a berserker, so how could Iron have died unless AJ vigged him and is a lying, non-vig wolf too? And then that means that enig is almost certainly not a wolf, which means eep is a lying wolf too and we have three lying, arguing wolves making shit really complicated after night-killing the fourth wolf in an 11-person game. I prefer to believe the simpler version; Iron was a guardian.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36737.html#msg36737">Quote from: Dr. Agon on July 13, 2012, 11:32:42 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am suspicious of eeps claim, but I still think AJ is full of shit.&nbsp; no way vig and my shit is in this game.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Your role is such a liability though. you did kill our guardian, after all.

It&#039;s not overpowered, just crazy and leads to complicated shit like what we&#039;re in now.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t get is why exactly you were so damn sure AJ was a wolf. the reason you specifically gave was:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36737.html#msg36737">Quote from: Dr. Agon on July 13, 2012, 11:32:42 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the reason I did not believe AJ was that the first person (wolf, seer, guardian, whoever) that attempted to interact with me during the night I would kill. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Which isn&#039;t really a reason. Was it only the &#039;no way are both these roles in this game&#039; thing? If so, why did you make it sound like you had definitive evidence against him?<br /><br />As for eep&#039;s claim, the breadcrumbing helps of course, but I always wonder how many wolves leave multiple breadcrumbs for multiple roles and pick them out as needed. It helps that in her case these were things she seems to have gone somewhat out of her way to say, so I&#039;m on the inclined side of believing her (plus, I mean, I thought enig was decent wolfy candidate to start with), but will reserve room for doubt.<br /><br />So, we have Iron as the dead, confirmed guardian. eep as the maybe priestess, Dr Agon as the maybe porcupine and AJ as the maybe pack-in-ass-assain<br /><br />If all of these claims are true, that_kid is a wolf and game is over, afaik. I doubt that more than one of these three is lying, so tomorrow I will try and work out the consequences of each case.<br /><br />One final thought is that enig.matic totally dropped out eventually. I somehow doubt this was entirely due to external circumstances. As before, I continue to be more suspicious of those who didn&#039;t seem to care much about persuading people as the day drew to a close, though the exceptional case of something like Dr Agon pulling votes off his buddy enig and making up a silly role is also something to consider.<br /><br />My list, due to suspicions and what I see as likely scenarios:<br />That_kid<br />Dr Agon<br />eep - LiquidAngel (tie, for unrelated reasons)<br />mystic<br />guy<br />AngryNarwhal<br />death butt

				i have been reading the thread and came to very similar conclusions<br /><br />i don&#039;t trust every claimer, exactly, but i can see and am willing to believe the scenario in which they are all telling the truth. as i guessed, dr.agon&#039;s reasoning for aj was really stupid.<br /><br />but for balance reasons, it all seems fair. priest, ok, that&#039;s pretty good. guardian, another ok role. but then a super, super limited vig and then a power you can&#039;t control? if priest takes the place of a seer, for instance, that seems like a relatively balanced pack of powers.<br /><br />i also have one more thing to add, and that is that i mostly believe eep because one thing has been bugging me about enig.matic for ever. in his obsession over math he failed to account for the fact that we don&#039;t know how many wolves there are... he kept mentioning two, two, <em>two</em>. there&#039;s two.<br /><br />humans aren&#039;t going to make the assumption that there are two without evidence. but a wolf who knows he has exactly one partner would.<br /><br />this helps iron&#039;s case: he mentioned the possibility of more than two wolves.<br /><br />interestingly, eep did *not* mention that. but she may also have simply been correcting enig.matic&#039;s math. i also put absolutely 0 weight on her stupid &quot;breadcrumb&quot;, especially when we <em>just</em> talked about the fact that it&#039;s so easy to game. and this one doesn&#039;t even use two separate players!<br /><br />due to this, i&#039;m willing at this moment to believe each of the claims<br /><br />which means that we get lynch, vig kill, night kill, and then d3.<br /><br />can we try to come up with something to seal the deal by tomorrow?<br /><br />that is, assuming we know some roles (wolf, guard, vig, priest, weird vig) can we create a set up that guarantees our win tomorrow <em>without</em> the possibility of a backfire if one of them is lying?

BUT ANYWAY. a couple things i&#039;d like to get out of the way before i possibly disappear (along with many other disappearances)<br /><br />assuming eep is telling the truth (which is still tentative but somewhat likely) we can really look at people who voted enig. for hints about that. keep in mind they could easily be moved around, but the votes at the end of the day are extremely likely to be good hints.<br /><br />(aside: eep, your power is for lynch only, or...?)<br /><br />if you go through the votes, i believe there is only one living person who never voted for enig, ever. i may be incorrect, of course. i find this very interesting. it&#039;s also interesting that there was a plurality vote on him <em>multiple</em> times. each time with different people. hm...<br /><br />vote trails may be very important in this game. more important than other arguments usually are, roles/balance/meta and such.

				I re-read some stuff, and Dr.agon&#039;s case against AJ during day two is completely non-existent. I did not re read anything from D1, but it should be safe to assume that his case would be considerably stronger against AJ if his claim was true. There is nothing whatsoever to back up his weird vig claim, and lynching him rather than AJ would prove absolutely nothing. <br /><br />As a steadfast Dr.agon non-believer, I have to wonder, why did he vote for himself? <br />My guess is that a second/third wolf could gain credibility by lynching him. <br />Or he could simply be throwing us off, expecting us to be three hundred miles away from this topic by the end of today. <br /><br />I could really easily see him and eep in this together. <br /><br />P.S.

				I will confirm that the thing with AJ and my butt was merely a joke.<br /><br />Okay I&#039;m gonna spin this on its head a little bit.<br /><br />I&#039;m the seer and I have standard seer powers. I viewed <strong>that_kid</strong> last night and he&#039;s a dirty no-good lying snitch. I did not breadcrumb because I&#039;m very paranoid about that sort of thing, especially as a seer. I viewed him because he was the least proactive active player leading up to the lynch, he didn&#039;t have a claim that could be used to test him and a hunch I had. Also, I read the list of players to my roommate (who doesn&#039;t know anything about this game) and asked him who to view and he instantly said that_kid, so that&#039;s also what got him on my radar.<br /><br />This means that I know eep&#039;s claim to be true, because she was the one who went out of her way to get enig.matic lynched and she&#039;s been pushing harder and harder on that_kid today. <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that there are only two wolves and we have the game won, but even if there aren&#039;t, getting the first two lynched in the first two days is not a bad start. If there is a third I have no idea who it is.<br /><br />I am also inclined to believe every single claim that has come out so far. I know eep is telling the truth, which means that AJ is innocent (because that_kid would not have had his vote on a wolf AJ). Dr Agon&#039;s story makes complete sense, even if he was being dumb, plus that_kid is trying to make us doubt it. LiquidAngel&#039;s claim just doesn&#039;t make sense for a wolf, as far as I can tell, but his is the one I have the least confidence in.<br /><br />Of course the problem with being a seer is getting people to believe you. I was going to try and figure out a logical solution that everyone could agree on, but I realized it&#039;s probably better to claim first and then work out the logic with all of you guys, though I&#039;ll still try and start one right now.<br /><br />My angle is that we need to lynch that_kid today. If the game doesn&#039;t end then and there, then either I&#039;m lying or there&#039;s a third wolf. eep&#039;s fate is tied to my own. If I&#039;m lying, then I&#039;m a wolf and enig.matic was not (because I voted/encouraged voting for him), which means eep is lying as well and if I&#039;m caught we both go down, which is pretty shitty do do even if there is a third wolf besides us two. Conversely, anyone who thinks I&#039;m telling the truth must also think that eep is. I think that&#039;s pretty solid evidence that I am not lying, but let me know if you find holes in it.<br /><br />If there is a third wolf then the game will not end after lynching that_kid. AJ has to kill someone tonight or never, so I&#039;d suggest Dr Agon or mystic. It might also actually help this scenario if Liquid gets himself killed before the day is up, just to narrow our choices.<br /><br />But, I need you all to come up with ideas that work based on your own knowledge and beliefs. For those power roles that have not explicitly claimed yet, please do so only if you think you know a way we can use it to guarantee a win by D3/N3.<br /><br />Finally, I chose this moment to claim for a few reasons. First is that I figured I need to do it today because why the hell would I risk being night-killed when I know two of the wolves for sure. Also, tomorrow I&#039;m going on a trip and won&#039;t be able to post as much, so I felt it&#039;s probably best to do this now rather than while I have potentially spotty network/power, less time, no computer etc. Third, I was waiting for all the claimants to have their say and for that_kid to post more. By now I think we have enough information that we can work out a foolproof solution.

				If you ask me, it would seem like if a Seer was going to claim, it would have to look exactly like that. I don&#039;t really see any holes in his logic. <br /><br />Therefore I trust him. Not trusting dr,agon sort of implies trusting AJ. Trusting deathbutt implies trusting eep.<br /><br />So, it looks to me like if we lynch <strong>that_kid</strong>and AJ Vigs dr.agon, that could very likely be game. <br />We shouldn&#039;t lynch dr.agon because he asked for it. What&#039;s up with that? I don&#039;t know. But it&#039;s way too fishy to go along with, even though I absolutely want him dead.

				^this was my point. But it is a bit odd that only iron died, and dr.agon accounted for that. if the wolves felt like they were in a pinch because of the number of role claims, maybe they would have prioritized not confirming a human?<br /><br />either way, it seems to have worked out for them, more or less.

				so there are several things i am not liking about any of this death butt vs that_kid stuff.<br /><br />death butt&#039;s role is overpowered compared to most of the other roles in this game. I have a pretty weak priest role, given that there are apparently a ton of other ways for players, human or wolf, to die. guy&#039;s role is sort of interesting but isn&#039;t really all that strong. guardian is never a really, really strong role, just one that can sometimes get lucky. But a full-out seer with &quot;normal seer powers&quot;? That&#039;s pretty strong.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why that_kid has been playing the way he has if he basically just can&#039;t be night-killed. Wouldn&#039;t it be better to hint at, say, seer and get the wolves to target him? This, coupled with the presence of a guardian in the game, makes me think he&#039;s most likely to be 3rd party.

				i agree that that_kid&#039;s playstyle has been a little strange considering his role, but he hasn&#039;t really been in any danger of getting lynch, no reason to get defensive<br /><br />he&#039;s also fairly innocuous and was claiming to be a plain human and not much else. it&#039;s usually safe for wolves to target people that don&#039;t give any evidence. so, it&#039;s not completely out of line for him to do what he did yesterday<br /><br />yeah he didn&#039;t abuse his power 100% but he didn&#039;t ignore it either?

				Aww, don&#039;t be butt-hurt, Bubbles the Soap-Dropper.<br /><br />I crack myself up, but more seriously, I&#039;m making fun of you because you&#039;re a wolf in distress and I get to call you out on that kinda stuff. Please excuse my dickery. To make it up to you, I&#039;m a corporate espionage guy who used to break into homes and offices to steal documents and stuff, but then I got turned in by a client covering his own butt or something. Now I use my sneaky skills to learn about alignments. Apparently I figured out your alignment by watching the cells at night.<br /><br />Maybe that means I&#039;m crazy. Maybe Iron was a shitty doctor and killed himself while trying to defend himself and Dr Agon is the real bad guy&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36810.html#msg36810">Quote from: eep on July 14, 2012, 06:42:34 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. the fact that you seemed to be hinting that you thought i was a seer.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36807.html#msg36807">Quote from: death butt on July 14, 2012, 06:29:15 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Also, why are you interpreting that_kid&#039;s behavior as if he knew what his role was when he just said he had it wrong until now?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />2. are you asking me?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36806.html#msg36806">Quote from: death butt on July 14, 2012, 06:27:50 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">And why would I go all-out seer fake-claim D2 to get someone who was already under a decent amount of suspicion and not an immediate threat to the wolves?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />3. you might have hoped that I would side with you because you gave me a bit of a boost/confirmation. you might have felt like it was safe because I had &quot;confirmed&quot; you to some degree (at least to me) in outing enig.matic as a wolf.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1. Oh, no I wasn&#039;t. It was something about you being a less powerful role or something. <br /><br />2. you and mystic both<br /><br />3. I was careful in my claim to distinguish between [believing in me =&gt; believing in you] and [believing in you =&gt; believing in me]. I don&#039;t think you guys are <em>that</em> dumb.<br /><br />mystic, your fears are understandable, and yes I will probably not see D3, (Pro-tip, if we lynch that_kid, none of us will!) because AJ or the wolf team will kill me depending on whether I&#039;m lying or telling the truth. Good thing is, once you realize I was right all along, you can lynch that_kid and win.<br /><br />Anyway, the point of my claiming wasn&#039;t to make you guys believe me; I don&#039;t pretend to think I&#039;ll ever be able to prove myself. It was so that we could go about figuring out a way to tell which of us is lying without risking the humans, so that&#039;s where I&#039;d like to see this thread go. Fortunately I&#039;ve said the most important stuff before I have to go, so I really hope you guys get cracking on this.<br /><br />a final thought for everyone. Just try and think through the scenario where all the claims made so far except for that_kid&#039;s are entirely true. Everything makes so much sense from my perspective, so maybe putting yourselves in my shoes will convince you, or at least point the way towards a foolproof type plan.

				liquid insisted that aj needed to be lynched, though. Why are you both considering dr.agon/aj a combo but liquid an okay lynch?<br /><br />also, one of thatkid/deathbutt MUST be a wolf, so really we&#039;d be better off lynching both of them than lynching neither.

				or, since shit is already too complicated and who cares if i make it more so:<br /><br />if death butt is a sorcerer (ie: human seer aligned with wolves), he might have just made a claim against a human (especially one who can&#039;t be NK&#039;d) and then if they both get lynched it could help make up for the loss D1. This would explain two wolves because 3 wolves+sorcerer would be pretty mega overpowered.

				actually, i had forgotten liquid&#039;s statement. hm...<br /><br />but i disagree incredibly strongly with lynching one of a binary argument. one of them is a wolf (aligned) ok. but that means the other is a pretty big target for the wolves. why do their job for them?<br /><br />your second post seems a lot more likely. i don&#039;t think we should screw with them for now.<br /><br />but then who?<br /><br />i feel like making a web of all the possibilities. there are so many claims and accusations, there are like 8 possible setups of roles now.<br /><br />i feel like the chance of death butt sorceror is highest, followed by his being a wolf then being a human. after all, if we do lynch death butt and eep the theoretical priest sees him as human, it looks like we were wrong and then finish off that_kid anyway. seems like a pretty good move to come out so angrily right away against the one block that might stop the wolf (and therefore sorceror) victory...

				I don&#039;t think I want to think about anything else until liquid comes back and explains why he thinks we should lynch aj. Yes, it might kill him, but if he gives a good argument and we get a wolf, that&#039;s totally worth it.<br /><br />death, butt sorcerer also makes sense to me given enig.matic is a wolf, because the former might not have known that. So anyways, to go through the list:<br /><br />guy - in the end i am pretty sure he is human for several reasons:<br />(1) enig vote<br />(2) role confirmed by aj<br />(3) generally seems to be looking for an honest explanation to what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />AJ - unsure<br />&nbsp;<br />dr. agon - I think he&#039;s probably human, although he was trying to divert us from an enig.matic lynch.<br /><br />mystic - unsure<br /><br />that_kid - normally as a wolf i do admittedly feel like he tries to breed more chaos.<br /><br />death butt - most likely sorcerer<br /><br />liquidcraig - I don&#039;t want to lynch him because I want him to explain why he wants to lynch aj, and then if it&#039;s a good idea we can lynch aj.<br /><br />AngryNarwhal - probably human because of enig vote.

				alright, so I&#039;m caught up, but just a single quick read-through so I probably missed something.<br /><br />I pushed hard for AJ for one reason on day 1<br /><br />I thought that there was a high chance that I would kill a seer or guardian or whoever and the snitches would kill someone else.&nbsp; this would &quot;confirm&quot; aj if he was a wolf and chose to jump on the situation to prove himself.&nbsp; I would be left as a counterclaim who ignored his day 1 claim and who are you going to believe?<br /><br />that said, there is no reason to lynch AJ now as he can still confirm himself and then we have less people to choose from as possible wolves.<br /><br />the reason I am voting for myself and that I encourage all of you to do the same is that it will give you one less highly suspicious person to waste a lynch on for a later day when the likelihood of catching a wolf is much higher.<br /><br />I say leave AJ, eep, Liquid (until he comes back and finishes his claim.&nbsp; I had a guess but I may have been wrong), death-butt, and that_kid alive.&nbsp; death-butt can be confirmed by dying and we then are sure to have that_kid and game over if eep is right.&nbsp; if AJ doesn&#039;t kill someone (and given the spoon yesterday, if you believe me, we will know the difference between a gun kill and a snitch kill anyways) than&nbsp; he is also a wolf.&nbsp; I see almost no situation that doesn&#039;t allow us to find at least one wolf tomorow.<br /><br />I wanted to fear guy&#039;s power as a mark, but that seems wierd given the deathbutt vs that_kid scenario.

				Egh. Sorry I&#039;ve failed to be convincing(ly polite :P) as seer.<br /><br />To clarify, I have only received information about that_kid&#039;s alignment and his flavor. Whether he has an additional power is unknown, but Dieter told me he&#039;s Bubbles the soap dropper, a snitch, &#039;and will do anything to get out. anything.&#039; I have never suggested anything otherwise, though I have been unclear/unspecific on the matter because the flavor doesn&#039;t matter one bit.<br /><br />I admit, thinking on it again, that my trusting eep isn&#039;t quite foolproof, as it is possible she was bringing up that_kid with the intention of later changing her mind, but the fact that she still hasn&#039;t removed it only makes my gut feeling stronger.<br /><br />Anyway, in the end I really don&#039;t give a rat&#039;s ass what happens as long as that_kid is lynched before he wins, even if it comes down to the last three. It&#039;s not like he&#039;s got an important role or is super helpful, so I feel like this isn&#039;t so much to ask. As long as he dies I will have done my job.<br /><br />I will not vote for anyone but that_kid while I am alive unless you guys come up with some crazy scheme that will ensure either my being proved or him dying and I highly doubt either of these will happen.<br /><br />There is the mild possibility of a third wolf, but the way you guys have acted, the claims that have been made and my seer knowledge all converge to make me feel confident that that_kid is the last. the only worry is that he can recruit someone to his side, but it sounds like Dieter just made him immune to NK&#039;s (ie, AJ and DrAgon), so that&#039;s not a likely situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this means that I can&#039;t really play the game with you guys. I&#039;ve said all that I can say and I can&#039;t speculate or analyze because to me, I already know everything with reasonable certainty and to you all I&#039;m a totally biased observer. Everything I say will come up the same; everyone is innocent and truthful except for that_kid, who&#039;s the last wolf alive. I&#039;ll answer anything you guys ask me and do anything you guys decide to require of me, provided it is not taking my vote off of that_kid, but I see little point in doing much else in the current situation besides keeping an eye out for trouble. Convenient, as I won&#039;t have much time to play anyway.<br /><br />good luck and kill that_kid.<br /><br />Oh and the name&#039;s Dog. Mad Dog, the Master Sleuth.

				Oh sorry, forgot about that question.<br /><br />I explained this before but I&#039;ll do it in more of a narrative form. <br /><br />the day had just ended and I was trying to decide who to pick. I asked my roommate, who had stopped by to ask me about something else, which of the players (whom he knows nothing about) I should view. I used a list of Dieter&#039;s that started with that_kid and as soon as I said it, he told me that&#039;s who I should pick and didn&#039;t change his answer. I already had mild suspicions of him, but I looked into it more and noticed how he wasn&#039;t trying to do anything but just kinda be present as the day ended. Everyone else on at the time was sort of frantically trying to sort out the mess with all the claims or trying to swing the vote one way or another. I looked at the other players and decided against viewing any of the claimants, for the same reason I didn&#039;t want to lynch them. That left only a few options and that_kid seemed the least knowable and the least human. I told Dieter in my PM that I figured if that_kid were a wolf, he&#039;d blindside me on D3 or D4, whereas I&#039;d probably notice something with the others.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know who I will view tonight. I never decide before the lynch, so this is not unusual. I may make an exception if it seems to make sense to do so.

				That&#039;s a good idea with the names, eep. I was thinking of something similar earlier but it didn&#039;t work with my expecting to be killed or something. I won&#039;t divulge who I will choose to view, but they will be selected from that list. I think maybe AJ and myself should choose from mutually exclusive lists so we don&#039;t risk targeting the same person. <br /><br />I would say our situations are pretty different from each other, given that i know who the last wolf is and whatnot. Anyway I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been unpleasant to anyone except that_kid, and that&#039;s because its fun to watch a wolf squirm and one doesn&#039;t often get that chance. With the other stuff I was just saying I&#039;m not going to try and analyze shit or point out all the wolfy things that_kid is doing because it&#039;s pointless to try and convince you guys of anything other than that he needs to die at some point. <br /><br />Re: balance, I think this game is balanced with two wolves, given that both dr Agon and and AJ were just as much liabilities as they were helps and the other roles except guardian and seer are pretty minor. Guardian + seer + 2 masons vs two normal wolves in a game this size would be similarly balanced, especially since at least one wolf here was given a power (NK immunity, nullifies the risk from vig and maybe dr Agon). in fact with all this, these other smaller powers people are claiming and hinting at are needed to balance it out. <br /><br />On top of all that, my believing you, as mystic says, clears a bunch of people and liquid&#039;s power claim guarantees that he will not win as a wolf. There isnt any way I can account for the presence of another wolf so yes, I&#039;m convinced we&#039;re on the cusp of winning this thing.

				you do realize that watching a wolf squirm is contingent on the rest of us believing that he&#039;s likely to be a wolf, right?<br /><br />the thing that doesn&#039;t feel consistent to me about this claim is why would a wolf honestly believe he couldn&#039;t be lynched? that would break the game, but it&#039;s something he&#039;s suggested since yesterday. Maybe he was just setting up for a lie, though. Also I don&#039;t see what being a soap dropper has to do with being immune to night kills so ???

				I mean watch him squirm as in watch him make shit up like &#039;I thought I was immortal&#039; in response to my claim. Not squirm as in fight being lynched because that&#039;ll be its own thing. (And i promise to try and not be a dick about it).<br /><br />And now for a bout of ignoring what I said about not trying to convince you guys about that kid&#039;s wolfiness because goddamn is he (well, from the perspective of someone who already knows he is, at least). <br /><br />Also, &quot;screw it, I&#039;m dead today anyway&quot;? I didn&#039;t want to say it but this is exactly the sort of thing that will draw shittons of suspicion in normal situations. Not sure why it didn&#039;t here, really. <br /><br />Also, check his reply to AngryNarwhal&#039;s vote on D1<br /><br />http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36462.html#msg36462<br /><br />Just noticed this one. SO suspicious in hindsight. <br /><br />the reason I was looking through his posts is to see what sorts of things he said about his immortality And I can&#039;t really find anything that makes me second guess myself. What exactly did he say D1 that is troubling you?<br /><br />But yeah, just got on my plane. Talk to y&#039;all later

				why are we all assuming that that_kid isn&#039;t just lying about his power altogether?&nbsp; in the case that death butt s telling the truth than I find it very likely tha_kid just made it up.&nbsp; on the other side, Death butt could so very easily be lying and sort of changed his story about his view a bit.<br /><br />I still don&#039;t think we should lynch either of them as death butt can attempt to confirm himself through viewing someone (not me even though I haven&#039;t given my name, just because I am suspicious and confirming through me isn&#039;t very good)<br /><br />the alternative is that the wolves kill death butt tonight and then we lynch that_kid.&nbsp; this will likely only happen if there is more than one wolf left.<br /><br />finally, eep and death butt seem to think that neither one of them is a NK target and that scares me as they can just say &quot;it doesn&#039;t make sense for the wolves to kill me now, it doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m not a wolf&quot;&nbsp; although that is true for me as well, it is because I no longer have a power.<br /><br />in response to guy, I never thought that was a wolfy power, just that it was a lie to cover up a wolf mark.&nbsp; although with AJ, if he is telling the truth, we can still kill him if we don&#039;t vote for him so maybe thats how dieter would balance that power.&nbsp; plus if he had tried to recruit me day 1 I would have killed him probably.

Don&#039;t put &quot;watching someone squirm&quot; above &quot;addressing fair questions.&quot;<br /><br />Here&#039;s some cliff notes relating to the death butt vs that_kid case. They stop at page 40 because I got tired of going through them.<br /><br />enig.matic defending that_kid (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36034.html#msg36034). Possibly just a joke/bit of douche baggery from last game, but could be evidence in favor of that_kid being a wolf. <br /><br />death butt voted (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36094.html#msg36094) and then unvoted (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36109.html#msg36109) that_kid early in d1.<br /><br />Dieter suggests that there is a seer (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36385.html#msg36385). Given this, the assumption that dr.agon&#039;s claim is accurate, and what I know, this leaves only mystic as the possible real seer. if he is a seer, I am unsure why he hasn&#039;t come out.<br /><br />that_kid votes enig.matic (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36388.html#msg36388) while choosing not to vote AJ because that would implicate him as a wolf by my reasoning. Dr.Agon&#039;s post after that is also interesting.<br /><br />that_kid talks about enig suspicions (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36462.html#msg36462)<br /><br />that_kid says that it would be funny to lynch him (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36612.html#msg36612), which i take as meaning he can&#039;t be lynched.<br /><br />death butt votes enig (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36616.html#msg36616)<br /><br />While mystic jumped on disbelieving death butt, angrywarhol jumped on that_kid (link (http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36792.html#msg36792))<br /><br />Also, there&#039;s this little fact:<br /><br />1. guy - ??? but recruits people into his gang and then they can&#039;t vote for him. i&#039;m going to assume he&#039;s a pimp.<br />2. eep - pedophile priest, does priestly things<br />3. AJ&nbsp; - bambam the smuggler, smuggles in a gun. both name and role name are consistent with power.<br />5. dr. agon - ??? the beserker, freaks out and kills someone, role is consistent with role name. (question: did he ever explicitly say that he&#039;s a beserker or did i just fill that in?)<br />6. mystic - ???<br />7. that_kid - soap dropper, is immune to night kills?<br />8. death butt - corporate espionage guy, for some reason named mad dog? does seer things<br />9. liquidcraig - ??? the dude who knows aj is a wolf (or something)<br />10. AngryNarwhal - tinkerbell the little sprinkle??<br /><br />Basically that_kid&#039;s power just doesn&#039;t make sense to me with his role. Were you given any more explanation, that_kid?

				haha i don&#039;t think that&#039;s what a pimp does, especially in prison. of course, i&#039;m reminded of that episode of the boondocks where dubois is in prison and the dude&#039;s huge dong reaches the floor<br /><br />anyway we should start coming up with some night plans. we have several theoretical actions (death butt&#039;s seer vision, aj&#039;s kill) and we can also plan our lynch around someone eep wants to see (so it kind of becomes a night action) - someone might die but planning all of them seems pretty good, right? we can base our votes off of who it looks good to see.<br /><br />i don&#039;t mind the idea of getting both that_kid and death butt if we&#039;re convinced that <em>one</em> of them must be a wolf. seer for wolf seems okay, and so does bulletproof for wolf? especially if it&#039;s the last wolf?

				it doesn&#039;t make it less likely (and i don&#039;t believe i suggested it does) but it doesn&#039;t matter, because matching it with the wolves is a good thing.<br /><br />think of it this way: what if he decides he doesn&#039;t believe you one bit, while say the rest of us do. he randomly decides you&#039;re the best shot. we can&#039;t plan around that, because we didn&#039;t know it would happen.<br /><br />again, i cannot see one reason (though i stand to be convinced) that he should secretly do it. the only reason he has, i believe, is so he doesn&#039;t match with the wolves, which again is a <em>good thing</em>. but it would also be a super thing to do if he were a wolf, no?

				I agree with Narwhal and mystic that it should be death butt.&nbsp; I like any 1 player for wolf trade in this game and pretty much any game, and I don&#039;t want to risk AJ not being able to confirm himself if That_kid isn&#039;t lying.&nbsp; thus if we lynch death butt it should be mystic.&nbsp; I am fully willing to lynch that_kid, but also don&#039;t believe his bulletproof claim as it is kind of what I was.&nbsp; two roles doing similar things CAN co-exist, but I don&#039;t think we have two (human) bulletproofish guys, and two (human) vigilante type guys (mine was MUCH more likely to get a human than wolf though).<br /><br />thus, AJ or that_kid or both are wolves I think.<br /><br />Liquid, we need to know what you know, even if it means you life.

				Vig is a good thing simply because it gives the humans extra opportunities to kill wolves, of which they are normally of short supply.&nbsp; by mystic&#039;s logic we should also not lynch someone because we could be lynching a human and thus be helping the wolves.&nbsp; also, the idea that AJ should DEFINITELY not make his own decision and instead listen to a majority vote is flawed in the same way that a lynch is always a good thing because it gives the wolves an opportunity to affect his choice (I think he brought that up).<br /><br />essentially, this is why mystic is SECOND on my list of candidates to be viged behind death butt (only if that_kid is lynched).&nbsp; he is not considering every possibility ever and thus being not mystic right now.<br /><br />I still think the best way to approach the situation is not TELL AJ who to kill, but to give him a list of people he probably wants to kill.<br /><br />mine, in order is:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Death butt (not if that_kid is still alive though, then we can see what new information death butt has to try and determine his humanity)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; mystic<br /><br />3.&nbsp; liquid, if he is still alive<br /><br />4.&nbsp; guy (on the off chance that he is a wolf who gets this ability to gain new members so they can&#039;t vote for him and it isn&#039;t unbalanced because of my power and two vigs.<br /><br />I would probably be on that list above liquid and guy, but I don&#039;t think it is necessary to include myself.<br /><br />at this point I see that the lynch is not going towards me and I am going to go with the lynch <strong>That_kid</strong> plan

I&#039;d prefer the list thing, minimizing the chances of my view dying. <br /><br />Also, I have no evidence for this one way or the other, but keep in mind the possibility that liquid angel wont die until the lynch or even the next morning. Liquid can perhaps tell us if this is a possibility.

				actually personally i would prefer to lynch death_butt, not have him be the vig kill. slight difference. but of course that doesn&#039;t work if that_kid is truly immune, and if he <em>is</em> the wolf, puts us in a bad situation. so, he&#039;s probably the best lynch.<br /><br />and also i would prefer there to be no vig kill. the very best thing we can do with it, provided we believe that one of that_kid/death_butt MUST be a wolf, is kill them both. and even that&#039;s basically a crapshoot. the best possible situation is a maybe while the worst is like, game-ending.<br /><br />in summary, in my opinion we should either lynch/vig that_kid/death butt, or lynch someone unrelated and vig kill NO ONE.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg36923.html#msg36923">Quote from: Dr. Agon on July 16, 2012, 01:06:47 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Vig is a good thing simply because it gives the humans extra opportunities to kill wolves, of which they are normally of short supply.&nbsp; by mystic&#039;s logic we should also not lynch someone because we could be lynching a human and thus be helping the wolves.&nbsp; also, the idea that AJ should DEFINITELY not make his own decision and instead listen to a majority vote is flawed in the same way that a lynch is always a good thing because it gives the wolves an opportunity to affect his choice (I think he brought that up).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I literally think every single thing in this paragraph is absolutely false. a game played perfectly by the humans would involve almost no lynches, but that&#039;s against the rules. you don&#039;t need extra chances to kill wolves, you already have more days than you need. Voting for a vig kill is flawed in the same way that lynches are flawed, yes, but that is not flawed very much. Wolves can influence it but they&#039;re going to have to come up with a good reason to shoot whoever. a good reason is going to be good coming from a wolf, a human, <em>a</em> seer.

				I think we should lynch that_kid and then we can vig me or not. Personally I&#039;d prefer to not be killed so I can view someone and confirm myself in the case that we have a third wolf. Of course if that_kid is dead the third wolf will probably want to kill me because I appear to be the last useful known power, so AJ should maybe not use his shot on me. It&#039;s up to him of course and I have little problem with dying as long as it makes sense to do so. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have the time to figure out if AJ should use his power or not, but I will say that the more important consideration is not the probability of him hitting a human, but rather if we can figure out how to use it as part of a logical scheme to confirm someone or ensure victory. <br /><br />That_kid is a Terrible vig choice because it&#039;s likely he&#039;s a wolf with vig immunity<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t think mystic should reveal his power unless by doing so he can help us prove things. Eep, it&#039;s suspicious That you&#039;re asking him. Same goes for narwhal, he should keep it secret. <br />&nbsp;<br />Should I make a list for potential views, or just decide on my own? I&#039;ll say now that even if we make a list, if something weird happens the lynch I may decide to view someone else, based on the circumstances. <br />

				the reason I want mystic and narwhal to make a claim is that everyone else has made a claim and it&#039;s often the case that when that happens, the leftovers are wolves who were just sitting around in flux for a while. narwhal is less urgent, but i don&#039;t feel i have any data on mystic whatsoever.<br /><br />I mentioned a list to you before, of the players who have not mentioned their names.

				i am in complete agreement with death butt&#039;s post except the understandable part where he fails to consider that he may be wolf with a seer-ish role<br /><br />no such thing as a true confirmation<br /><br />if there was a mark i feel like it could have been guy off of nothing but a gut feeling, but i certainly hope that isn&#039;t the case

				mystic, you&#039;re right I didn&#039;t take myself being a wolf into account. It is for this reason that I don&#039;t put a lot of stock in the confirming me idea, though it wouldn&#039;t be entirely useless. in any case I will view someone if I&#039;m alive and tell you what I find out, obviously. <br /><br />Also, aren&#039;t wolf marking powers often limited to later in the game? This was my impression but I&#039;ve never been in a game with a mark and don&#039;t know how you guys do it. However, that_kids complacency makes me think there might be a wolf.

				the basic idea for a mark, i have thought, is that they can use it anytime in place of a night kill<br /><br />it&#039;s an extremely strong power though, possibly the strongest normal power that the game can have<br /><br />if we have a mark in this game i wouldn&#039;t doubt just one original wolf...<br /><br />now obviously there can be any number of different twists on it, but the assumption that it can&#039;t be used until later is not very useful

				again, it varies. sometimes it&#039;s a specific player who can mark another, other tiems it&#039;s just an option that the wolves as a group have instead of a night kill.

				we have no idea<br /><br />just about everyone seems to have a role, and each of those roles has reasons it could possibly be a wolf with that role<br /><br />people who voted for enig.matic are a good start, but as you&#039;ll notice you&#039;re the only one not on that list, if i remember correctly. you could narrow it down to people who voted for him in the end. but this is all based on eep&#039;s telling the truth. so.

I would like to continue playing, but I just don&#039;t really have the time to catch up to the game at this point so I&#039;m half useless. I did just gather that deathbutt claimed seer and viewed that_kid as a wolf. <br /><br />in which case <strong>that_kid</strong>. I take it that that_kid claimed bulletproof or something similar based on snippets I have picked up. Is the only way to kill him a lynch? That would make so much sense. Having a wolf with bulletproof and 2 vigs? That is straight genius. Chances the the vigs will end up doing the wolf&#039;s killing for them without having too much chance of actually killing a wolf. <br /><br />I apologize if that was already stated.

				also aj because it&#039;s interesting that twice in this game people have been deadset on killing you and promised they would be able to proove it and in the end only ended up being really silly<br /><br />also there&#039;s almost no doubt in my mind that you&#039;re human because you could have done more to save yourself and i feel you would have been more adamant to do so as a wolf<br /><br />another thing i&#039;m wondering is why more people aren&#039;t suspicious of liquidangel. if he really does have vig powers and disbelieved aj for that reason, how/why is the answer come out and die instead of shooting aj himself

				because I didn&#039;t believe AJ at first, but after seeing the other roles in this game I see why we could have 2 vigs.

I don&#039;t believe a human to have the ability to force votes off of yourself in a game where we maybe have 2 vigs. That is Danny clearly giving the humans a way to take care of you.

				it really just seems like liquidangel is proposing and doing things that aren&#039;t actually intelligent but maybe seem reasonable and then justifying them just like he does every time he&#039;s a wolf<br /><br />i think my ability can be useful lategame if i&#039;m lucky with targets too, so i&#039;d like to have me around<br /><br />i think i&#039;m a good target for the wolves too. liquidangel killing me and especially saying he will do it is bad in every aspect. it allows the wolves (if he&#039;s telling the truth and has a vig power) to ignore me and target someone else because he is doing the work for them. if i&#039;m left alive, the wolves have to choose between leaving me alive and getting rid of others that are threats to them<br /><br />although i will commend liquidangel at this point for being the only one to throw suspicion on me which might save me from night kills

Killing me makes most sense because for all I know Danny might just up and decide to kill me at the end of the day anyway. Although the fact that he is trying to do it with death_butt claiming that_kid as a wolf is fairly odd and incredibly suspicious. I haven&#039;t had the time to read the rest of this thread though so I don&#039;t really know the arguments involved in the that_kid/death_butt struggle. <br /><br />P.S. fuck you, 5 new replies were posted while I wrote this and I&#039;m not editing it.

				well that sort of has something to do with it<br /><br />but in your mindset, looking at it as strictly you&#039;re vig and aj claimed vig and not knowing what has been going on in the game, it makes even less sense to do what you did. not reading the thread doesn&#039;t explain why in this situation you kill yourself instead of killing him<br /><br />it&#039;s like you&#039;re hiding behind the fact that you haven&#039;t been able to keep up, even though to me it makes it more condemning

				I&#039;m a vig limited to night and I can&#039;t say I&#039;m a vig (although, so far Danny hasn&#039;t done anything about this). AJ&#039;s description was different from mine in a way that made it still somewhat believable to me that he could actually be telling the truth. I just didn&#039;t see why the human&#039;s would ever need 2 vigs. But with death_butt&#039;s view and that_kid&#039;s claim combined with your role it makes a lot more sense why 2 vigs could exist in this game. 3 wolves. KC is regular. That_Kid is bullet proof from the vigs. you are able to make humans not be able to vote for you so the vigs have to take you out. Humans have 2 vigs, a seer, a priest, a guardian, a berserker (which is a luck role and could go either way in a game with this many auxes), and whatever angry wants to claim. That feels like it would be a very balanced game.<br /><br />If I&#039;m being honest though, I don&#039;t really think it is that likely you are a wolf. I just feel like a power like yours is more of a wolf power than a human power. I&#039;m more suspicious of mystic, and I do believe we have 3 wolves. Especially with the line-up I just listed. Even if you don&#039;t want to believe my claim it is still one hell of an impressive line-up for the humans. <br /><br />Unfortunately this just looks like I&#039;m trying to pull the same shit as last game. hahahaha<br /><br />Also, the reason I keep repeating myself is because it feels like you keep forgetting.

				Why do you feel that way? It is the fear of a lynch that brings information, not the lynch itself.<br /><br />you&#039;re asking for two lynches anyway, provided liquid is going to die.<br /><br />I guess I can get behind vig target him. But I don&#039;t see the point. We won&#039;t know if he died from that or his role, unless we actually get flavor for it, which I really, really doubt. So we get a bonus kill (and humans just love killing) and no extra information.<br /><br />Unless you&#039;re the priest and you believe death butt. Then you can see if that kid was a wolf. But that doesn&#039;t exactly help all of us and even in that situation no vig shots should be made.<br /><br />Not to talk about what &quot;wolves do&quot; but I&#039;m certain in most cases they would jump on the idea of vig just shooting randomly.

				Well I guess it doesn&#039;t explicitly say that I will die. It just says that if I talk about my weapon before using it the warden will find out and have his guards brutally beat me.<br /><br />I took that to mean death, but seeing as I&#039;m not dead who knows. I doubt the clause would be in there for just flavor. Also, it isn&#039;t as simple as dead OR lying. It is dead OR lying OR misinterpret what Dieter said in my PM to mean dying.

				I mean. I was already planning on being dead right now, so you could do worse than killing me. Right now I think killing me over that_kid doesn&#039;t make sense though. One vig killing another vig isn&#039;t exactly a terrible idea, but to me it seems dumb just because you are for sure using a vig to kill a human (from my point of view) instead of using it on something like guy, who I really think is a wolf based on that shady as fuck power.

				Using kills on people for hunches is stupid, end of story. Don&#039;t fucking shoot guy.<br /><br />that_kid or liquid should die today. I prefer liquid, but that_kid is fine.

				i viewed guy and i made it extremely obvious yesterday that i knew. he never picked up on it. i was trying to get him to know and no one else.<br /><br />i think angrynarwhal might have picked up on it and was trying to see if i knew something.<br /><br />i am open to the idea that my views are wrong, which would involve guy lying to us about what team he is on<br /><br />it explains my jumping on death butt yesterday, which i eased up on as i realized similar roles are possible

				i don&#039;t really know what happened last night<br /><br />i knew i was suspicious for not coming out (seriously guys what the fuck?) so i knew the vigilantes would decide to shoot me for some reason. vigilante is like the dumbest role. anyway i tried so hard to make sure no one would do it, because no matter the target it would have been bad. i assumed they would think i was a safe target though, regardless of my pleas<br /><br />i don&#039;t know all things that happened last night<br /><br />basically i got my view and was told that they knew i was doing it, so i got out of there before anything further could happen<br /><br />it&#039;s possible i witnessed the start to other people heading there and using their abilities on them: i don&#039;t know

				well because (if mystic really did name drop) both mystic and deathbutt have been confirmed as having viewing abilities combined with the fact that at least one of them must be lying (IF eep is telling the truth), then one is sorcerer. it is possible, however, that both deathbutt and mystic are telling the truth and eep is lying. it is not possible that both eep and mystic are telling the truth<br /><br />since there are now six humans left, at least one wolf must be among the dead (probably)<br /><br />there are two likely groups of wolves at this point<br /><br />if eep and deathbutt are telling the truth:<br />that_kid, enig.matic, and one of the remaining players<br /><br />if mystic is telling the truth:<br />angrynarwhal and many combinations of two others. this could be deathbutt/eep if they are lying or eep/that_kid if deathbutt is telling the truth but eep isn&#039;t (fully)<br /><br />if you&#039;re strictly looking at one of deathbutt/mystic lying, it doesn&#039;t make any sense for mystic to be sorcerer, especially from my point of view. he gains nothing from what he said about angrynarwhal and just looks a bit crazy. on the other hand, deathbutt lead the lynch, and stood to gain a lot by lying the way he did<br /><br />this doesn&#039;t take into account any of the nonsense with dr.agon, aj, or liquidangel. though i think it possible that liquidangel is a wolf with an extra kill ability that he just wasn&#039;t allowed to talk about. though because he was willing to out himself (and suicide) i doubt this is the case. wolf trading for vig doesn&#039;t make much sense<br /><br /><br />i have more but i have to ponder a bit more first<br /><br />

				if mystic were sorcerer, he could have said angrynarwhal was human and that i am wolf and been a whole lot more believable and probably gotten me killed. since this also wouldn&#039;t contradict eep in every way, he could have had her vote (and deathbutt&#039;s) against me as well

				Hey guys, I&#039;m here, cool your jets. Not that this post is going to cool anyone&#039;s jets...<br /><br />I viewed <strong>eep</strong> last night. She&#039;s a convicted priest (her characters name is pencilman jefferies) who apparently thinks she&#039;s been wrongfully imprisoned for molesting boys, but I&#039;ve checked the facts and know it&#039;s true. As with that_kid, it&#039;s implied that we&#039;re raping her and she&#039;s snitching on us to stay alive until she can get out. <br /><br />the flavor text doesn&#039;t quite make sense to me but honestly the whole game&#039;s flavor is a little nonsensical. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have a lot of time right now, so I won&#039;t try and work out what the hell happened last night yet because I have no idea. I viewed eep because I was growing increasingly suspicious of her throughout the day. I figured I&#039;d have to hide that suspicion to stay alive and it seems to have worked. <br /><br />It&#039;ll be hard to get you guys to believe me, and honestly I&#039;m a tiny bit concerned I&#039;m insane, as two for two is crazy good, but I was less than surprised about either of them turning up guilty. I felt pretty confident about eep by the end of last night, I pm&#039;d dieter as soon as I saw the day was up.

				it has nothing to do with your play, really. or any suspicious nature to your claim<br /><br />just that, as you pointed out, one of you and mystic has to be lying (or you have to be wrong)<br />if you&#039;re wrong, deathbutt is also wrong or lying<br /><br />if mystic is lying, eep is probably telling the truth, so deathbutt is also lying (or wrong)<br /><br />i guess the scenario of mystic and deathbutt telling the truth seems more likely to me. even if it means two seers and a wolf priest<br /><br />if either mystic or deathbutt is telling the truth and sane, then you are lying or wrong. that&#039;s what really does it for me<br /><br />also if eep is telling the truth, deathbutt must be lying or insane. the only situation where this makes sense is the one i mentioned about that_kid being marked. so it&#039;s possible, but a lot less likely than anything else<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg37206.html#msg37206">Quote from: LiquidAngel on July 18, 2012, 11:05:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Another scenario is that they&#039;re both crazy.

				dueling packs<br /><br />it explains why both death butt and angrynarwhal voted for enig.matic, and consequently jumped on that_kid.

				well <br /><br />after lynch 5 players<br /><br />if liquidangel shoots, day 4 will be either 4 or 3 players, depending on if wolves pick the same person. then after the lynch would be 3 or 2 and game over<br /><br />if he doesn&#039;t shoot, day 4 will be 4 players. then after lynch 3 and with night kill game over<br /><br />so i think it would maximize the chance of a wolf lose if he used it tonight, no?<br /><br />either way tomorrow is the last day

				&nbsp;Still trying to work out the events last night. AJ went for mystic but got confused or something. Angry narwhal was sent to solitary for suspicious behavior. Dr Agon was murdered. Sounds to me like wolves killed dr Agon, narwhal had some sort of protector power for mystic. Narwhal ran away when he saw mystic approaching with his view and AJ approaching with his misguided kill and was then apprehended by the guards. <br /><br />Of course that would require that AJ didn&#039;t actually kill anyone. Did your pm make it clear that you actually killed him?<br /><br />It would also imply that mystic is the third wolf, because why would a wolf have a power that he takes a hit for a human? <br /><br />What I don&#039;t get is why eep thinks she was wrongfully convicted but my &#039;facts&#039; say she&#039;s actually a child molester. Like, how do you get that wrong?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see any other likely scenario or any serious logic holes unless AJ knows he killed someone, even though he doesn&#039;t know who. <br /><br />If mystic is telling the truth, then what happened last night and what was narwhals power he was talking about that mystic would know about?&nbsp; Why would he do that at all as a wolf, unless he knew mystic actually knew about it and might confirm him? Why else would AngryNarwhal be dead?<br /><br />I find it much more likely that eep hoped to solidify my apparent trust in herself by confirming my view while killing the person on my list whom I seemed to trust the least, dr Agon, while mystic continued to view unclaimed roles. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: guy (paraphrased)</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> why don&#039;t we just wait 18 months for enig to get out?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Haha, took the words right out of my mouth <br /><br />I don&#039;t buy dueling packs at all, particularly because it seems I&#039;d have to be in one if there were and I&#039;m not :p<br /><br />AJ, re your most recent post, how does that account for me vs eep?

				Also if there are two wolves left that&#039;s 4v2. Lynch a human and wolves NK, we get 2v2, which means we&#039;d need to lynch one wolf and vig the other, else it&#039;s loss or wake up to 1v1 and we get stalemate, which I assume is wolves win?&nbsp; Is 2v2 already a wolf win?<br /><br />Add in liquids power and the game changes. Lynch human, NK human, vig wolf, we get 2v1, which means a fighting chance if we set up a lynch one/vig the other with two opposed players. obviously it&#039;s better to kill both wolves and win tonight if we could guarantee it, but really that opens us up to missing both, too<br /><br />Since I know eep is a wolf but could be mistaken about mystic, perhaps that means we should lynch and vig eep and myself and pray the remaining humans can sort it all out. Of course my view could come in handy during crunch time, but either the wolves will kill me or they&#039;ll leave me alive to cast doubt on me and get me lynched so maybe I won&#039;t be the most useful person left.&nbsp; But I can&#039;t tell how a plan like that looks like from the perspective of you all. <br /><br />If it were possible to find three people who trust each other pretty well, they could arrange the lynch and vig so that two of them will be left alive to kill the third we tomorrow. But that&#039;s probably not feasible. <br /><br />Another option might be lynch and vig mystic and eep?<br /><br />Of course this all assumes liquid is actually telling the truth. But, given the numbers game, it seems like we should probably find a way for him to use his kill tonight if possible. the odds of choosing at least one of two wolves with two picks out of six players, minus one as this assumes LA is actually vig are really quite good.

				it&#039;s just flavor so i pay it little mind but i did see &quot;multiple&quot; figures before i left<br /><br />anyway, i like how we&#039;re so worried about the number of players left today, even though yesterday there was a chance that a million people could have died and everyone was fine with that<br /><br />i think what sucks the most is that someone (or maybe multiple someones) gets wrong views / doesn&#039;t have a working night ability<br /><br />or that everyone&#039;s night abilities are broken<br /><br />which really makes it hard to actually try to get something done<br /><br />anyway, a quick recap for a second:<br /><br />guy makes mobs, aj confirmed that that did happen. it agrees with the flavor mystic saw.<br /><br />mystic claims seer and that (guy is human) and (angrynarwhal is wolf) which guy confirms, but angrynarwhal was &quot;killed&quot; last night. mystic&#039;s alignment is unsure, but it is clear that he has seer powers.<br /><br />eep claims priest and that (enig is wolf) and (that_kid is wolf). obviously neither can prove nor deny. one view is consistent with death butt view, but then death butt is incriminating eep.<br /><br />death butt claims seer and that (that_kid) is wolf and that (eep) is wolf. one of these agrees with eep, but not the other, of course. alignment is unsure, but he can at least see accurate names.<br /><br />aj claims vig that smuggles a gun in. of course, he used a knife to stab someone. and doesn&#039;t know who he stabbed. two people &quot;disappeared&quot; last night, so this is consistent with a vig kill along with a night kill, at least.<br /><br />liquidcraig claims vig and that he dies if he admits. now, he didn&#039;t die. he also didn&#039;t make a kill. he can&#039;t prove it either way and said an untruth (since he didn&#039;t die)<br /><br />now, it&#039;s hard to look at this. i&#039;m not commenting on play, or lying. but rather completely objectively. consider that up to everyone may have non-working, incomplete, or simply lied-about powers. looking at the facts, maybe we can determine who is ok and who is not, or at least find a safe lynch.<br /><br /><br />( oh also this lol:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,921.msg37150.html#msg37150">Quote from: AJ on July 18, 2012, 08:18:28 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ither that or Dieter is a really good boy and thinks weed makes you trip. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />getting high can be called tripping are you claiming weed doesn&#039;t get you high )

				Yea, I have no idea the fuck is going on. As far as I can tell Dieter is just dicking around with everyone, and not actually telling us what we do. I would like to use my kill tonight, but I have a pretty strong feeling that it will end up with me dead (which is fine if we get a wolf with the lynch). <br /><br />I believe that as soon as I go to use the shank, the warden will have me beaten, which makes sense. My PM doesn&#039;t actually state that I will immediately die, just that if I talk about having a knife before using it I will be beaten by the guards. It doesn&#039;t give a time frame. There is a pretty solid chance that I die when I use it. I&#039;ll still attempt it, but you should all probably know that this was probably the reason if I turn up dead tomorrow.

				Hmm, I don&#039;t like that liquid will likely die if he uses it. We can&#039;t really afford to lose people right now and it&#039;s not even clear if his vig will go through before he gets killed. We&#039;ll have to be careful. <br /><br />mystic, I cared about the numbers and things yesterday too. Obviously we could have afforded to lose more players then so my focus was more on trying to find a way to clear people and guarantee a wolf death than keeping all humans alive. <br /><br />So, dr Agon was murdered by AJ, who targeted mystic. That much seems pretty clear if we want to trust him, and is actually probably true whether he&#039;s a wolf or not. that could still be the effect of angry narwhal&#039;s power, but then one wonders why he was removed from the game. Either mystic is lying and narwhal was removed as part of his saving mystic power ( which means his ability saved wolf mystic at the cost of two humans ) or the snitches got him, or mystic is telling the truth, in which case I have no idea what happened because it would seem the wolves didn&#039;t do anything but lose narwhal. <br /><br />Also the point of being a snitch is to get it in good with the guards, so why would he be sent to solitary? <br /><br />mystic, can you tell us the names, titles and flavor backgrounds of yourself and narwhal? I have an idea. <br /><br />And I don&#039;t see how anyone can believe eep but suspect me. If she&#039;s telling the truth then I have been instrumental in the lynching of my two wolf buddies for no good reason. She herself has cleared me. <br /><br />If there are dueling packs, why did only iron die N1?&nbsp; It&#039;s believable enough that the wolves targeted him, but if there were two teams it&#039;s much more likely someone else would have died. <br /><br />eep, human you would have that reasoning but wolf you thought I trusted you. <br /><br />More thoughts brewing, but gotta go for now.

				eep, that&#039;s what I was trying to get at by asking mystic. I figured maybe the wolves all had a reason they were being raped because apparently we&#039;re a prison rape gang or something. <br /><br />a convicted pedophile, innocent or not, will often be raped in prison. It&#039;s part of why we send them there. Not all new guys are, I don&#039;t know why you seem to expect it to be the other way around, eep. That brings me to another, thankfully only mildly rape-related topic. <br /><br />When she claimed yesterday, eep mentioned that she was a wrongfully convicted priest. There was no reason for her to lie about this, really, as it&#039;s just a bit of flavor. When I viewed her, my pm said that She does indeed think she&#039;s been wrongfully imprisoned, but my character checks his facts and knows its true (and that she&#039;s being raped).<br /><br />Point is, I find it kind of odd that despite my views being mostly accurate in terms of names and flavors, both of my views claimed their names etc before I revealed them, this is the only discrepancy I found beyond snitch vs not snitch.&nbsp; it could be hinting at some sort of strange mechanic, perhaps dueling packs, perhaps mistaken identities or mistaken views. <br /><br />This is also just a weird flavor thing and could be written off as slightly sloppy work on dieter&#039;s part (no offense, please don&#039;t smite me!), but I was just wondering if you guys see anything in it.

				Not good guys, we need some talking going on today. We can&#039;t vig tonight because if LA dies we lose unless we lynch and vig both wolves, assuming there are two left. <br /><br />I think everyone agrees that at least one of myself, eep and mystic is a wolf. If you believe me, eep is a wolf and so is mystic most likely. If you believe her, mystic is the wolf, I think.&nbsp; If you believe mystic, you trust me less than eep. Mystics claim about AngryNarwhal doesn&#039;t make sense. Both me and eep are suspicious of him, so maybe hes the best lynch candidate. I&#039;d agre to lynching him if people want to but eep is lowest risk.<br /><br />Remember, if we miss the lynch, we pretty much lose. If you&#039;re not talking today it&#039;ll be your fault.

				I&#039;m really not sure what to do at this point in the game. There&#039;s almost no way to look at it logically. Everyones roles are so broken and possibly not working that it&#039;s hard to approach in a meaningful way. It&#039;s difficult not to just wing it and hope for the best, and that the game doesn&#039;t just screw with us.<br /><br />One thing we can do, again, is try to lynch someone who can&#039;t do anything tonight and use the wolf kill to try and confirm what people have been saying today, along with getting new evidence from the night. So, AJ seems like a fairly good choice there. If eep lives then she can say what AJ actually was (instead of Guy, who has already been &quot;outed&quot;), if I live I can say what my seer view was, if death butt lives he can say what his seer view was, and if anyone of us die then it helps to confirm what we had been saying (which really only helps assuming there is just one bad guy left which I really hope at this point, because I have very little hope for us left if there are two)

				i don&#039;t see how that really helps anything though<br /><br />any of you could just lie to say whatever is the most believable <br /><br />i guess we could possibly learn something from the night kill, but i think we would either way<br /><br /><br />and death butt, i don&#039;t have any concrete reasons, but as others have said, you have seemed more suspicious throughout the game. also i don&#039;t really know what&#039;s going on at all<br /><br />i don&#039;t think liquidangel is a wolf because he thought we lynched iron. <br /><br />i am less suspicious of eep because if you were telling the truth/not crazy and she were a wolf, i don&#039;t know why she wouldn&#039;t have killed you last night. i mean there&#039;s the obvious reason of people already wanting you dead, but i think the risk of you outing her would outweigh that. and it&#039;s not like much really gets confirmed or changes if you had died. it would&#039;ve made you definitely human and shown that eep was very likely not lying. (so how would this not be a better move for her as wolf?) assuming she isn&#039;t wolf, you probably are<br /><br />as far as mystic, i just don&#039;t really want to think about why he would say angrynarwhal is a wolf with what happened. dueling packs is i think really the only logical explanation here. i don&#039;t know what else to say about that<br /><br />aj because i don&#039;t like the idea of wolf vig and that&#039;s about it<br /><br />tell me about the holes in my logic because i&#039;m sure they are aplenty

Clearly she&#039;s done a decent job. She is much more experienced than I am. I can sort of read people but being convincing is another thing altogether and she knows she&#039;s got the upper hand on me there. Narwhal was a better choice because nobody really suspected him. <br /><br />mystic is trying to cast doubt on everything and isn&#039;t really being helpful. This helps him weaken the argument that his narwhal claim doesn&#039;t make sense with AJ&#039;s murder. AJ bloodied somebody up and it was not narwhal. the only explanation for narwhals death is night kill. If he were a wolf, how did he die and where did the wolf NK go? What was narwhal talking about yesterday? It jus doesn&#039;t make any sense at all if you take three minutes to think about it. <br /><br />And if both mystic and eep are telling the truth, narwhal was the third wolf! No way were there three wolves and a mark. If you believe mystic to be a lying snitch then you have to believe that eep is too. Otherwise you have four wolves again; me (for fake-claiming against eep), mystic, that_kid and enig. If you believe me, the only wolves are that_kid, eep and mystic and they killed narwhal last night after narwhals power saved mystic from AJ. <br /><br />mystic can&#039;t make sense of it because he&#039;s dug himself into an illogical hole. Im not saying that I&#039;m using perfect logic myself, because obviously pure logic is impossible here, but I&#039;m makin a strong plausibility argument. Dieter isn&#039;t being such a huge dick that nothing in this game makes sense and all of our roles are bunk and dueling packs and crap. mystic is just saying that so nobody thinks about it too hard. <br /><br />I&#039;m telling you to think. Whose claims are easier to believe?<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and check in once more before lights out. Don&#039;t let the wolves make you lose hope.<br />

So why not vote for her first? What&#039;s to lose?<br /><br />If you think I&#039;m lying about eep, then you think eep is not lying, so you think I was a key player in the lynching of two wolves in the first two days, which only a really really dumb wolf would do.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you think I&#039;m telling the truth but am just throwing my partners under the bus, then vote for eep because she&#039;s my wolf partner and you&#039;ll hit a wolf!<br /><br />If you think I&#039;m just tryin to get you to vote for eep so i can pull some crazy power out of my ass then you think dieter gave me seer powers AND some crazy power that lets me win against five humans or x humans and a dueling pack.&nbsp;<br /><br />So vote for eep, not me.<br /><br />#####<br /><br />If you lynch me I can all but guarantee we will lose then and there because it will be down to 2v2. I won&#039;t take responsibility for this pending human loss because you all have stopped trying, which is disappointing.&nbsp; Call me a douche or whatever, but this isn&#039;t cool.

				No, actually, for real.<br /><br /><strong>eep</strong><br /><br />I don&#039;t really disbelieve eep. Actually I don&#039;t believe or disbelieve anyone. But no matter what, eep cannot have a dialog with another player about her power. There&#039;s no way to catch her in a lie, or find out if she&#039;s insane. Death butt and I can at least view the same player, for instance, even if only by chance. Or each other. Or anything. But eep cannot.<br /><br />If she accepts that it must be one of us three, then she is the absolute best choice. Her power is not falsifiable or useful.

				FUCK. I can&#039;t a single scenario that makes much sense. So here I am going to make my cases for the 3 players.<br />p.s. This will probably be a giant post.<br /><br />Case 1: Deathbutt<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 1: Seer</span><br />If Deathbutt is a true seer then that means that eep must be a wolf, and mystic is either crazy, sorcerer, or wolf seer.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 2: Crazy Seer</span><br />If Deathbutt is a crazy seer then eep is a crazy priest (or a human who is lying about her role). She cannot be a wolf because Deathbutt viewed her as a wolf. in this scenario, all three claims could be human.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 3: Sorcerer</span><br />Here we have one wolf left and it is NOT Deathbutt. Deathbutt tries to gain credibility day 2 by giving us a wolf, then turns on the priest day 3 to hopefully get us to kill her and save the actual last wolf. in this scenario, mystic and eep are telling the truth and the actual last wolf is either Guy (mystic could be crazy), AJ, or me.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 4: wolf Seer</span><br />This scenario is pretty much the same as sorcerer except Deathbutt is an actual lynch target.<br /><br />So in the case of Deathbutt I don&#039;t believe we should kill him because there is only a 25%&nbsp; chance he is actually a wolf (this is actually less because wtf wolf seer).<br /><br />Case 2: mystic<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 1: Seer</span><br />If mystic is seer than Deathbutt can&#039;t be meaning that he is either crazy, sorc, or wolf seer. All three cases clear eep.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 2: Crazy Seer</span><br />in this scenario Guy and eep are both wolves UNLESS Deathbutt is also not actually seer.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 3: Sorcerer</span><br />Pretty much the same as crazy seer. Except now Guy and eep pretty much have to be wolves or both eep and deathbutt are crazy.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 4: wolf Seer</span><br />This is the same as sorcerer scenario wise except mystic is now a Lynch target.<br /><br />So here we have mystic at also 25% (which once again is lower because wtf wolf seer).<br /><br />Case 3: eep<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 1: Priest</span><br />If eep is priest, then Deathbutt is sorcerer or wolf seer, and mystic is cleared.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 2: Crazy Priest</span><br />If eep is crazy, then so is deathbutt and we&#039;re pretty much boned because we based a lot of decisions on their views. This means that anyone other than them can be wolves (specifically guy and mystic who are clearly aligned right now).<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Possible Role 3: wolf</span><br />If eep is a wolf then Deathbutt is seer (or an asshole sorcerer). This means that Guy must also be a wolf because I will not buy us having 2 seers.<br /><br />So here there is a 33% chance of wolf, but the wolf part heavily effects Guy.<br /><br />SO in the end. My vote falls on <strong>Guy</strong>. I clearest flow I can find without heavy contradiction is that Deathbutt is sorcerer, mystic is crazy, and eep is priest. If this isn&#039;t the case then we have 2 wolves left most likely and we&#039;re boned anyway.<br /><br />Now explain to me where I am wrong. I am kind of sick right now so I may have missed some shit.<br />

				the reason i choose deathbutt:<br /><br />if eep were a wolf, i doubt she&#039;d also be priest<br /><br />she&#039;s pretty much as confirmed as being priest as someone can be. deathbutt told us that when he said her actual character was a priest as she said<br /><br />in my head it makes sense for her to have claimed priest from the very beginning if she were a wolf (with no powers), but not since death butt confirmed that that&#039;s what she actually is<br /><br />at least, this scenario to me seems the least likely. and if eep is not a wolf, then death butt is at the very least wrong and well that&#039;s a reason<br /><br />also. i don&#039;t think mystic is the crazy one. there&#039;s a reason against it: it has to be either eep or death butt, because there is a contradiction in what dieter told them about eep&#039;s role. eep thinks she is innocent, while death butt assures himself that she actually isn&#039;t and that his facts are straight. this probably indicates that one of them is the crazy one. i doubt there are two crazy people with role checking abilities of whatever kind, but this is a mental institution and why not. i don&#039;t know<br /><br />i&#039;m also starting to wonder if my role has something wrong with it as well. maybe i&#039;m the reason that angrynarwhal died. or maybe i&#039;m the reason that aj got retarded when he tried to shoot last night

				Character doesn&#039;t have to be linked with role though.<br /><br />It&#039;s a perfect claim for eep to say she&#039;s a priest when she is one, even though she isn&#039;t, right?<br /><br />Anyway, it basically comes down to that if we have two wolves left I have no hope for a win at all and if there&#039;s one, eep doesn&#039;t help. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m changing my vote. Both me and death butt can catch whoever else in a lie (aj, liquid) while eep cannot.

				If someone views liquidangel (or even if two people do it) and his role is absolutely nothing like he said it was, then some people have some explaining to do. There is never a such thing as confirmation, as I&#039;ve said since day one. I feel that, in some way, killing non-aj&#039;s is equivalent to not talking at all tomorrow.<br /><br />This situation can NEVER come up with eep, anyway. She can never have a dialog with other players about her claims, unless the person we lynch is a person that has already been viewed. That would be you. Do we lynch you? That doesn&#039;t make sense to me because everyone is relatively certain you&#039;re human. (No such thing as confirmation, remember.)<br /><br />I basically see: giving up now (including if there&#039;s a tomorrow) or not doing that, which as I see it involves killing AJ. Alternatively, if everyone is completely certain it&#039;s one of us three, the choices are hope for randomly getting it, or trying to set up some way of actually trying to figure it out (which may involve trying to determine who is crazy seer, perhaps by seering each other) and also seeing what the night kill brings.

				Yea, 50% powers are just stupid. Especially if you aren&#039;t told your power has a failure rate. <br /><br />Also, I am pretty ok with people viewing me. If I am still alive tomorrow it will allow me to better refine my analysis because I will know who saw me wrong. the only downside to this is that I plan on using my power tonight, and seeing as how I came out with it when I wasn&#039;t supposed to, I have a feeling that won&#039;t go over too well.

				Whose names do we still not know? Mystics, I think? And maybe guy? Liquidangel? Does AJ know guy&#039;s name?&nbsp; Don&#039;t reveal any until after we view or something. Could somehow end up being important, though its not particularly likely any views will do much in the way of proving anything. <br /><br />Guy, I don&#039;t understand your reasoning about eep not claiming priest as a wolf priest. I&#039;d also asvise against putting too much stock in ambiguous flavor stuff. <br /><br />I still don&#039;t understand what people find hard to believe about my perspective. It doesn&#039;t require any insanity or crazy role unpredictability or what have you. I don&#039;t know dieter all that well but I feel like however many novel roles he put in, he&#039;d at least try and make sure it wasn&#039;t too crazy with insane seers and guys power doing unknown things and crap. He seems to value logical play a little more than that. Narwhal having a deflection power that saves a wolf from a vig? Makes sense to me. Insane seers and other unknowables? Doesn&#039;t sound like dieter from what I know of him. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to get back on today. Make the right choice. <br /><br />Liquid, remember that if you die, you kill someone, the wolves kill someone and we lynch someone, there will only be two people left. So, be careful and don&#039;t miss...

				i thought the same about death butt during the first day (i said that, yes?)<br /><br />oh and never mind about what i wanted to do i guess. i simply don&#039;t understand why adding more information, even if lies, can ever be a bad thing. it&#039;s not like you automatically believe lies, and tomorrow we may have more information to figure out how things said or will be said are lies. with no extra information we&#039;re just exactly where we are now, waiting to die. unless we get lucky. which i don&#039;t want to rely on, that&#039;s just stupid.

				my question with that is what you plan on doing about two wolves regardless<br /><br />you make it sound like i&#039;m personally aiming to not hit a wolf<br /><br />the thing is, i find each person as a wolf equally likely so given those metrics i have to sort by another factor<br /><br />in that situation no extra information is just as damning

				i don&#039;t find everyone to be equally likely to be a wolf i guess is the difference<br /><br />i think we have one or two wolves among eep, death butt, mystic<br /><br />so the way i see it, lynching outside that, even though it gives us information, reduces our chances of winning

I remember I said that human you and wolf you would have different reasons for claiming that_kid was a wolf or something, but that&#039;s just negating an argument that something you did was human-y, not calling you human. I find it very believable that you are a wolf based on your actions. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering why mystic is pushing an eep lynch, because if I&#039;m right all he has to do is lynch me or anyone else to win, which wouldnt be very hard. But, that&#039;s why I&#039;m pushing for an eep lynch; mystic is still a bit of an unknown and by some weird mechanic could actually not be a wolf.

				Day 1 Enig (eep&#039;s partner gets killed). Eep chooses to claim priest knowing what enig&#039;s role was. (If there is someone else to verify enig&#039;s role this almost confirms her). Day 2 crazy seer says that that_kid is a wolf. Eep and angry take advantage of this to push a lynch on that_kid. Day 3 Eep tries to confirm herself by saying she agrees with the &quot;seer&quot; only to have the seer turn on her later.<br /><br />I feel like this works.

We know that it isn&#039;t your power to kill someone based off of your view otherwise guy would have died earlier. So the fact that I said I was goin to use my power and then two people wound up dead should be some form of clarification. Also, the fact that I had been gunning for guy since I started reading the thread should show you that I was suspicious of him. <br /><br />What is your real role? I highly doubt seer.

				I shot guy because I really didn&#039;t like the possibility of him being a wolf with that power, and it justified two vigs in my head. Also, yesterday I explained why I put my vote on him. in most of the scenarios that I wrote out he was likely to be a wolf, so I went with it in my gut (and I honestly I thought I would end up dead anyway you guys will see what I mean at the end of the game when you see my role). Now that I know he was human, because why else would the game still be going? I want to turn on AJ because if guy was human AJ is less likely to also be a vig. Although both of us showed that 2 people died the night we chose to use our powers. I just happened to actually hit my target.

				So you don&#039;t trust your own views then? I mean, I guess at this point it makes sense not to. the thing is that I&#039;ve been pretty suspicious of you from the start, but there hasn&#039;t ever really been a reason to kill you. the reason I didn&#039;t shoot you last night was because I was hoping to use your view to determine what I thought about you (and was going on the fact that you were hopefully the real seer and would view either me or AJ so you would know who to side with.) I took a pretty big gamble with it and it didn&#039;t exactly pay off. the main reason I want to vote for you right now is because I believe that you and guy could have been partners seeing as your other 2 views died. <br /><br />I would have no problem believing this is the case if it weren&#039;t for the fact that the whole eep/deathbutt shenanigans went down.

				I chose to shoot guy, and was expecting one of you or deathbutt to be the night kill if it wasn&#039;t guy so I figured today would come down to at least having me or AJ in it because going in to today we would seem the most suspicious and would make easy targets (especially me if I lived, again, most of the reason I was hoping Danny would kill me). <br /><br />I know the wolves didn&#039;t kill guy last night because I got a pm explicitly stating that I was the one who shot him. They may have also targeted him though, and just arrived after me. I don&#039;t know about that. Then you could&#039;ve been the one to have killed deathbutt. I could believe a seer and a seer who has a chance to kill his views. That would seem balanced.

				Those are also all very possible, and seem as though they could be likely. If guy thought deathbutt was a wolf it makes sense for him to choose&nbsp; him to join his gang. We already established that he wanted angry, and it also explains why he wasn&#039;t killed when you viewed him. I&#039;m guessing last night guy could&#039;ve been the wolf target (if he was a human he would definitely be the most likely candidate.)<br /><br />This also leaves AJ in an odd position again seeing as he aimed at you yet missed. I have empathy for him though seeing as my role didn&#039;t work how it was supposed to either.

I am sad though, because if you are telling the truth, that means humans would have won today if you didnt shoot guy. I do find it interesting that death butt was killed...

				I also kind of want to vote for him because he was the &quot;seer&quot; that was left alive, but I specifically played that card against that_kid last game. Also, he didn&#039;t try to pass off death_butt as evil but instead outright stated that he was the seer. (of course all of that could be a play so I hit this exact conclusion)

				There are a few reasons I want to vote for <strong>liquidangel</strong> right now, as unfortunate as this makes the set up. I&#039;m still up for reasoning and argumentation though.<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m about 50/50 on this issue.<br /><br />However, this is a weird game. There could be so many different things that happened. Weird roles, marks, and other possibilities.<br /><br />Liquid has been under the radar the entire game, and the people we suspect our wolves have not voted for him almost ever. AJ has been fought against by various people the whole game, including most of our wolves. Even if some of our suspects were not wolves, this doesn&#039;t clear everyone.<br /><br />How dangerous do you believe it is to throw your partner under the bus that early?<br /><br />It&#039;s true that his power allowed someone to die. Somehow. But the person he shot and the reasoning regarding it is extremely suspicious. Why shoot anyone at all, when we&#039;re so close to winning? Guy is non-human if and only if we believe that my views are false AND that a wolf could have the power that he did. It doesn&#039;t make sense. It&#039;s so likely that we&#039;d be 3v1 to a wolf which is way easier to figure out than 2v1...

				hahaha, that&#039;s exactly what I was thinking. <br /><br />I made a post yesterday explaining why I was still suspicious of guy. It was the giant one that I voted for guy at the end of. the reason I killed him last night is because if he were a wolf with that power the best way to take him out is using my power. I feel like we&#039;ve already established that wolves have odd powers this game, and that is one that makes sense with 2 vigs (yes, I am aware this goes against my vote now, but that is because the game did not end with my shooting guy). <br /><br />the thing is that neither one of you are people I wanted to be stuck with on the last day because I wasn&#039;t extremely suspicious of you yesterday (although earlier in the game both of you were the top of my list making this fairly interesting). I honestly see scenarios in which&nbsp; either one of you could be a wolf and that sucks because I can&#039;t see a viable way to reason through it. Too much is happening behind the scenes with shit we don&#039;t know. For example, deathbutt and eep see roles backwards and mystic and Guy take advantage of this. On the otherhand. We have the scenario discussed earlier where AJ is a lying wolf who was able to slide through.

				If I were lying about my ability, wouldnt I just say I killed dr.agon? the only reason anyone even knows my ability messed up is due to the fact that I myself admitted it. Why would I do that to myself? Rather, I thought honesty to be the best policy.<br /><br />the fact that you off&#039;d guy makes me pretty suspicious of you, I must admit. the 2v1 scenario does typically work in favor of wolves, as they can turn the remaining humans against each other. At first I voted mystic because of that, but I havent decided if mystics sudden switch after I called him out is in earnest (it does makes sense) or if it is a rather transparent plot.<br /><br />tl;dr I have idea what is happening

				Consider not just that he shot guy, but that he (says he) thought he was going to die doing it.<br /><br />Say you&#039;re the wolf AJ, he just lost the game for the humans if he really believed that.<br /><br />OR he was afraid of guy&#039;s power as a human and shot him.<br /><br />If there was a mark, Liquid is like the perfect choice, too.

				Well yea, I mean. I would vote for myself today if it came down to it. Danny pretty much lied to me about my power.

I really want to know what actually went down the night angry died. Technically two people did die and AJ makes a strong point in at least claiming that he missed. What happened with you? I still don&#039;t get how you were able to survive. Something is not adding up from that night and the blackhole does seem to be around you. I guess at least both night AJ and I used our powers at least 2 people died. That counts for something, and based solely on that evidence you are the only person who hasn&#039;t fully proven your role (with the exception of guy not being your partner).
