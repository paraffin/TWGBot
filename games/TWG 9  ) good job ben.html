				This is the thread. I&#039;m getting rules and roles together now for handing out. Expect more information, a PM, and the game to start within the next 24 hours.<br /><br />[Host = Guy]<br /><br />Players:<br />1. Diage<br />2. Phil<br />3. Ben<br />4. Dr. Agon<br /><del>5. Haplo</del>- killed day 3<br /><del>6. That_Kid</del>- killed night 1<br /><del>7. Dr. Death</del>- killed day 4<br /><del>8. Enig.matic</del>- killed night 3<br /><del>9. Azrael</del>- killed day 2<br /><del>10.LiquidAngel</del>- killed night 2<br /><del>11.Reaper</del>- killed day 1<br /><del>12.Dieter</del>- killed night 3<br /><br />Please try your hardest not to post until the game has started. I know this may be impossible, and I suppose that&#039;s okay, but <br /><br />All information not contained here is contained in PMs. If you don&#039;t know something or are confused about something, you probably aren&#039;t supposed to know about it. There are countless reasons suggesting against outside talk, so please try to refrain from it. Everyone will get a generic PM. For this reason (and others), it is to your advantage not to make this information public. Some will get PMs with additional information. That said, specific PM discussion is forbidden, but general PM discussion is allowed. I made it so that it won&#039;t be like any other game where everyone claims roles and whoever doesn&#039;t have one is lynched.<br /><br /><strong>Rules</strong>:<br />-Votes may be changed twice.<br />-Days should be similar to last game.<br />-No talking at night.<br />-No outside discussion.<br />-Specific PM discussion forbidden. (quote, paraphrase)<br />-General PM discussion allowed. (i am seer)<br />-Don&#039;t talk to me in the thread. No exceptions. PM only. If you bring something to my attention that I feel is important, I will make it public. PM me any questions, though I may not answer them. Vote counts will be posted frequently, and if I&#039;m not around to give them, do it yourself. They will be pretty easy to follow.<br />-Don&#039;t death post. I hate it.<br />-Ask your PM for more information.<br /><br />Oh, and the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. <br />--<br />There are exceptions to many rules in PMs. PM me any questions at all. It&#039;s probably not nearly as strict as it seems, just don&#039;t be retarded.<br /><br />PMs are going out now. Day will begin shortly.<br /><br />I&#039;m including the generic PM so that it does not hurt you to claim normal civilian/human/whatever<br /><strong>Generic PM:<br />Have fun!<br /><br />the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.</strong><br />--<br /><strong>Story:</strong><br />For some time now, you have been living in the remote wilderness near the foot of a mountain range you have named the White Wall. the village you live in is far too small to be considered on any map, but it has always felt like more of a family than a village anyhow. There are thirteen others like yourself, all of whom you know by name.<br /><br />Or, at least, there were, up until a few nights ago, when the killings started. mystic, the breadsmith and faithful worrywart, was the first to go. Guy, the jack-in-the-box, died last night. the bodies were torn and clawed and raped and gagged and flipped and beaten and eaten and finally, neatened. It was a mystery how you actually knew all of these things took place, but it was also around the start of the killings that the absence of the sun began to bring out terrifying howls. Your family quickly coupled these howls with the deaths and suspected that there were wolves present. <br /><br />you know that the wolves are picking victims strategically, as mystic was the most important part of your family, followed closely by Guy. Without them, you are left hungry and bored. It was an inside job! It is probably a good idea to find out which of your brethren have been wolfin and kill em pretty neat and hard. At night though, you&#039;re usually too damn tired from the lack of mystic and too damned angry without Guy to give a shit, so you&#039;re limited to the daylight. Tough shits out here &#039;neath the White Wall, but I think some are more skilled than others. Better not to rely only on them, though. <br /><br />(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Castle_and_Merriam_Peaks.JPG/300px-Castle_and_Merriam_Peaks.JPG)

				PMs are out<br /><br /><strong>Day 1 start!</strong><br /><br />More info about day ending later, I&#039;m going to bed.<br /><br />First post is probably a pretty good idea to read. This game is different and I know some of you are against reading, but just give it a try.<br /><br />PM me questions.

				ok, so phil wasn&#039;t making a joke apparently.. i dont feel i should have to prove my role, especially in this game.. all i know is i play a very passive role in this game.. but an important one none the less.. furthermore, the burden of proof does not lay on me.. phil has made an accusation which is a far shot at best.. there are three assumptions one must make to believe phil, no four.. first, you must assume hes a human, then, you must assume hes a wolf, next you must assume matt put in a spy and that he is the spy, then finally you must assume that he viewed me/knew who i was.. however it works for a spy.. he must address and prove each of those to be given the faith of each of you beyond a shred of doubt.. and hes done nothing but immediatly claim a common wolf claim and point the finger at me.. furthermore suspicion is aroused when you note that kyle immediatly followed step with phil when phil has never done anything in these games that i can find to prove himself truthful.. all quotes i can find of phil are of him makeing an outlandish lie.. to believe him, now would be foolish i think.

I just said I&#039;m suspicious of you. I think you&#039;re the one voting all willy-nilly for people.<br /><br />And really, I mean, you did vote for That_Kid. But I&#039;m honestly more concerned about Phil.<br /><br />Did you see how long he waited before saying, &quot;Just kidding, guys?&quot; And only when That_Kid called him out on it. Although really, I still would rather kill Azrael or Enigmatic because they don&#039;t fucking play.

				because everyone was just voting for one person and that seems like a bad tactic in d2 since that gives the wolves the ability to killl who they want.. by picking one person at least WE control who dies in the daytime.. i personally would of picked dr. death first.. but i dont know how many wolves on this game and this tie breaker is shaky..

				Oh, and I had targeted Dr. Death because I figure the Dark wolf might be killed by the Jugglebug. I felt Dr. Death was suspicious and might be the dark wolf.

				it&#039;s too obvious to me that cole and haplo are wolves. I think that in one of their descriptions they specify the importance of the jugglebug, i assume in coles. Cole is not that active, haplo goes from saying give it to greg during the time greg was being most suspicios to saying give it to cole. (i think that cole realized that he needed the jugglebug and insisted he recieve it) Furthermore, i think KC had the ability to percieve a transaction pertaining to the jugglebug simply bacause of the brightness of it. I likewise noticed something important that i cannot disclose until tommorow about the item haplo requested. He was employing a certain tactic. As soon as they realized who had the jugglebug and figured that cole was not going to recieve it, they killed kyle. Now knowing what we all know about the game a wolf kills someone they consider important, the only thing important we knew about kyle was that he had the jugglebug. To me, that says everything i need to know.

				Sup faggots.<br />Here&#039;s what&#039;s up. ryan&#039;s right. Alot. It&#039;s very very obvious that Cole and Haplo are collaborating and not in a good way. Their efforts to attempt to kill inactive is always a good sign that a player is a wolf. additionally, look at the descriptions of other people&#039;s items. Ben wants a shield, KC wants a bow, haplo wants something made of wood. nice try, douchefag.

Recognition of my superiority.<br /><br />Ok, I think based on what Azrael and Dr. Death have said, that they both received the generic PM and are just plain humans. I don&#039;t know where you guys get off thinking Dr. Death is a wolf, he has barley even done anything and you think he is collaborating because he took a stance on someone and voted for them?<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the way that Phil just jumped the bandwagon and said that Haplo was a wolf, although I&#039;m not liking Haplo very much right now.<br /><br />Also, unless there are three wolves the game isn&#039;t over if we kill a human, plus the possibility that we may have already killed a wolf. So Diage how do you know that if we kill a human it will be game over, huh? Seems suspicious.<br /><br /><strong>Phil</strong>, until I see sufficient reason to change.

				actually, i miscounted.. i thought there was only 6 people left not 7.. if there were six and we killed a human today and they night killed then itd b gg assuming we didn&#039;t already kill a wolf.. but ben, the information is in front of you. i have minimal to no suspicion about phil, the connection about dr. death and haplo is that haplo has refered to dr. death seemingly randomly.. only after he sided with greg.. that invokes a rediculous amount of suspicion and to me points out obvious collaboration.. you don&#039;t have to speak to give off suspicions.. but trust me, go with haplo, and tommorow i will further explain why it is that i feel so strongly against haplo in specific. Cole i am only 80% sure on, but haplo im almost 100% sure.. more like 99.6%.. but pretty damn sure none the less..

				and furthermore, anyone who attempts to kill an active person needs a reason to do so, or so i feel..

I thought we were assuming two wolves, by Enigmatic&#039;s observations?<br /><br />Also, got a question. Diage and Enigmatic both want the bow. Which one is the real deal?<br /><br />Here&#039;s my thinking: Enigmatic &quot;saw&quot; information about the wolves to make it seem like he had an odd ability. There is the possibility that it happens totally randomly to pretty much anyone, but unless anyone else has witnessed something similar (and it&#039;s probably prudent to come forth with this info), this is not a chance occurence and is instead an ability. But, he also needs the bow. Does it seem likely to you that he has the ability to both become the vigilante <strong>and</strong> see transactions at night? I mean, it&#039;s possible, but he is probably lying about something. Keep in mind this is all contingent on the fact that no one else has seen anything. Also, now I can&#039;t remember if Enigmatic <em>needs</em> the bow or if he <em>started</em> with it. That would change things a little.<br /><br /><br />Diage, well, admittedly, he was the first person to say anything about the bow - that&#039;s pretty much guaranteeing that he at least needs it. As for his allegiance, I don&#039;t know. I think he&#039;s human, but it depends on what the deal is with Enigmatic. Eh, I could go further, but I&#039;ll see what you guys think or if you have corrections.

				Here&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking.<br /><br />1. Diage - disclosed his item first. I favor him over Enigmatic. Active.<br />2. Phil - not a huge fan at the moment. I&#039;d like to hear from him some more. But I still think he is human.<br />3. Ben - mentioned the shield. Nobody else has, so I&#039;m led to believe he is human.<br />4. Dr. Agon - I think Greg is harmless, but he also has no voting pattern<br />5. Haplo - about to get lynched. Could be a wolf. Could be a human with no role attempting to maximize the use of his life. Could have a role and was trying to prevent wolf targeting. He probably isn&#039;t a bad lynch, though.<br />6. <del>That_Kid</del> - killed night 1 - may have had an item<br />7. Dr. Death - made me angry, but I&#039;m thinking human. Was confused about his PM, so I&#039;m not sure what that is about.<br />8. Enig.matic - wants the bow but also seems to know info about the wolves. Not an ideal combination.<br />9. <del>Azrael</del>- killed day 2 - in retrospect, probably had no role<br />10. <del>LiquidAngel</del>- killed night 2 - apparently had no role<br />11. <del>Reaper</del> - killed day 1 - not enough info, may have had an item<br />12.

				lol<br />How is a D shaped item different? I was following your example of an unclear discription of an item. a wooden thing could be quite a few things, a bow or a stake are both possiblities. <br />a plain human dying at night is good. How much do I have to say that? the original plan was to stay quiet day one and then &#039;reveal&#039; myself having a good role.

				That isn&#039;t. I&#039;ve given substantial information, and am withholding even more for the sake of situations like this. I&#039;m not going to flat out give every bit of information I have, though my previous posts would suggest otherwise. Danny has done nothing short of just counter arguing. I know the transactions that have occurred, and that liquid wasn&#039;t supposed to die last night. Big shocker? Yeah, the wolves slipped up. Someones pissed, and Dieter has been the most avid of voting me out, short of Haplo. Hence why they&#039;re on a very high position on my list. Dieter is being a given a chance (in my eyes) to redeem himself, and if he doesn&#039;t shortly, ill just take the matter into my own hands.

				All right.. here comes some truth about this game.. i am human, i swear to it.. i think the bad person was enig.. im almost positive danny was seer.. if enig could view transactions he would of known i gave the staff to danny and the bow to enig.. if you havent figured it out yet, i started with all the items and i had to figure out what they were and then distribute them.. i had a stick, a board, a d-shaped object, sticky tape, and a juggle bug, ben you still dont have ur shield cause i thought you would of goten night killed by now.. and the note did warn me to be careful who to give things to.. the only possible explanation for what happened last night is enig killed danny and enig was night killed..

				well.. i could only pass one thing at a time.. so N1 i debated between the tape and the bug cause i figured they were less important, of course i chose the bug.. D2 i figured out you and enig.. i thought you would be night killed, so N2 i gave kc the bow (i figured id make the most of my pass).. during D3 i figured danny had to be the seer since he seemed like he needed an item but wouldnt want to say what it was (of course, a seer wouldnt make that obvious).. so i gave him the staff.. the thing is, KC claimed to be able to see transactions, of course he wouldnt sya he got the bow, but why would he vig kill danny when i gave him the staff?

				Ryan. I believe you. Ben, I am making assumptions about your role based on your item. you&#039;re guardian. I believe KC was vig, and that danny was seer. it fit his playing style.

				so we are all just trusting Ryan now? the guy half of you voted for to start this day?&nbsp; and am I suspected just because I wanted the item that I was told to want, albeit I acted rather strangely, but is that reason enough to decide to kill me?&nbsp; I am convinced that the wolf between us (maybe wolves) are phil and Dr. Death.&nbsp; only because I know I am human, Diage has given reason to believe that he is human, and we KNOW that ben is.&nbsp; that leaves phil and Dr. Death.<br /><br />between the two, phil has been a dick and has at times tried to reveal roles to us.&nbsp; at least I am pretty sure I remember him doing something like that.&nbsp; and IF Diage is telling the truth then we don&#039;t have to worry too much about cole, or we at least know if we can trust him.&nbsp; so I am going to vote <strong>Phil</strong> for now, but if we decide that we want to try and end this now and Dr. death is the more likely wolf then we can just lynch him now and try and end this as quickly as possible.

				im almost positive that cole should die by the dynamite, and if he does then good hes gone.. but heres the thing right, IF there are two wolves left, in my mind its either you, phil, or dr death.. if we kill dr death with the dynamite, then we can get two things accomplished by killing u or phil at the same time.. that way, we all agree that the person we feel is most likely wolf will die.. look at it this way greg.. if you die and arent wolf, humans should still win i believe..

				what do you want me to say?&nbsp; I want to live through throughout the game.&nbsp; I mean the only reason I&#039;m not all riled up about this is that I already knew this.&nbsp; you are being logical, unless there are two left then they win upon my lynching, correct me if I am wrong on this.&nbsp; Phil also seems more suspicious than me to me (duh?) but if we are worried about what I brought up shouldn&#039;t we lynch cole right now?

				iono, after all the games ive read up on.. phil isnt taking this as much as he usualy is.. phil to me seems more suspicious when hes actualy playing.. the fact that hes not jus seems to lead to me that hes more likely to be human.. and at this point in game.. that seems like an important conclusion...

				Does phil usually try and reveal roles?&nbsp; what is the safest route?&nbsp; would the safest thing to do be to lynch cole? if he and say phil were wolves (unlikely) and he passed the dynamite on (unlikely) then it would be two on 1 and the game is over.&nbsp; Same is true with me so we are back to the question who is more suspicious, me or phil.&nbsp; well, tell me what I have done that is suspicious and we will see what I can tell you.

				okay, fair enough.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know exactly how the guardian works, but If I were the wolf I DEFINITELY would not have tried to kill phil.&nbsp; Then there would be nobody left for me to try to lynch.&nbsp; it would be a ben and diage gang party to kill me.&nbsp; the only explanation I can come up with is you (obviously you feel strongly against me after not changing your vote last night) had been attacked, guarded (possible? or perhaps a special perk of the guardian?) and then lied saying that you protected phil.&nbsp; why would you guard Phil anyways?&nbsp; why not diage, hes the one I suspect to be more human out of Diage and Phil.&nbsp; you obviously don&#039;t believe that I am.

				Ok, well... I should probably let you know that I didn&#039;t guard Phil the previous night. I just said that I did in an attempt to bring out the wolf. My plan was that if Dr. Agon acted like a wolf I would keep my vote on him, if he didn&#039;t I would have changed my vote to Phil(killing him). Unfortunately, that didn&#039;t turn out very well. So I can only assume that the last wolf is Phil.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I really hope that you don&#039;t turn out to be the wolf Diage, that would be that gayest fucking thing ever.

				Dr. Death was most likely not a wolf. <br />Also, there was no guarantee that the dynamite would have exploded if he had passed it. There is no comparison to if I was a wolf and would have for sure won the game last night instead of faking a guard. There would be no pupose in that.

				I feel it is important to explain this game in its entirety to ben... <br /><br />First off, D1, danny was dark wolf and not sure who was light wolf.. (i think its been always phil).. N2 i gave danny scepter, but kyle gave danny the jugglebug.. danny consumed the jugglebug and gained the power to convert, but he was NOT seer.. and saw the staff as only a stick, he mistaked it as the bow and accused kc of lieing, from that he was certain KC was the light wolf (the objective is that the dark wolf must kill the light wolf to get complete night killing rights), so every other night, the wolves alternate who kills.. N3 i gave the dynamite to cole and danny converted me.. that was the same night we tried to kill kc before he could kill us, but it was too late kc immediatly phoned in his vig kill on danny.. therefore they both died.. but i was still alive with the shield and tape as the lone dark wolf, so i had every potential to claim human while being a wolf.. that makes me the perfect wolf!.. im not sure what specialty the light wolf had or why greg needed the jugglebug (thats the mainreason i thought he was a wolf, since it appeared as if only wolves needed the jugglebug, but i guess i was wrong since phil is the light wolf).. so yea, now its down to light wolf v dark wolf with a human in the way.. lol

I figured the Light wolf was actually different from me, and that he had vigilante powers. I legitimately didn&#039;t think KC could have all those abilities. Especially the part where he vig kills me at night. I had prepared the following post:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay guys, I didn&#039;t receive the bow the previous night. What I actually received was the staff, but I couldn&#039;t just say that yesterday because I didn&#039;t think our guardian was properly equipped yet. It has given me the power to investigate one person per night.<br /><br />I viewed Enigmatic last night. He was the Dark wolf, and he alternates night kills with the Light wolf. His goal is to kill all humans and presumably also his counterpart, as killing the Light wolf means they no longer have to alternate kills (for obvious reasons). He wanted the bow because of his &#039;unusual prowess&#039; with a bow. I can only assume this would turn him into a wolf vigilante.<br /><br />So I think we&#039;re down to one wolf.<br />What this means is that there is still the Light wolf out there, who must have killed Engimatic. Not sure if it was intentional or not to kill his counterpart.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also, I LOL&#039;d when I received the jugglebug and the bent stick (which I mistakenly judged to be the bow).

				<strong>Dr. Agon</strong>:<br />you are the Light wolf.<br /><br />you of course know that the source of the howls are the battles between you and your counterpart, the Dark wolf. you have entered a truce of sorts, and settled on alternating kills each night. you cannot identify the other wolf, and you cannot use any process of elimination because you have noticed more than one of your brethren sneaking out at night. you cannot identify the others either, as your primary focus is the wolf and the targets of your kills.<br /><br />you are equipped with an extra thick coat of fur. Shedding this coat will cause a random civilian to be chosen as your ally in the fight against your enemy.<br /><br />you love jugglebugs.<br /><br />Since you have a lighter heart than your counterpart, you have decided to let him go first with the killings, so you will not have a chance to do anything until night 2.<br /><br />Destroy all humans. Getting rid of your counterpart gives you full killing control.<br /><br />additional stuff: both wolves were the same but on opposite sides. if either was equipped with a jugglebug, they would gain the ability to shed their skin at will, choosing who to convert. if touched with the sticky tape, they would lose this ability because the tape would get all kinds of fucked in their fur. (doesn&#039;t apply if a jugglebug was ingested) otherwise, it was activated when they died<br /><br /><strong>Dieter</strong><br />you are the Dark wolf.<br /><br />you of course know that the source of the howls are the battles between you and your counterpart, the Light wolf. you have entered a truce of sorts, and settled on alternating kills each night. you cannot identify the other wolf, and you cannot use any process of elimination because you have noticed more than one of your brethren sneaking out at night. you cannot identify the others either, as your primary focus is the wolf and the targets of your kills.<br /><br />you are equipped with an extra thick coat of fur.

This will not be indicated in the vote count.<br /><br />you seem to have misplaced your shield.<br /><br />side note: you are an exception in that your identity might not be best hidden. you may paraphrase what is written in this pm<br /><br /><br />additional stuff: gains power to guard if given the shield. when he dies, he appoints someone to become magician<br /><br /><br /><strong>Diage</strong>:<br />you&#039;re the Scavenger.<br /><br />While living in your settlement, you have picked up quite a few items.<br /><br />Currently, you have the following items:<br />Board- some kind of board with sophisticated drawings on it<br />Jugglebug- some kind of glowing insect<br />Fancy &quot;D&quot;- some kind of fancy &quot;D&quot; shaped thing<br />Dynamite- a currently unlit stick of dynamite<br />Stick- a small, bent stick<br />Sticky tape- really sticky tape<br /><br />Once per night, you may pass an item to a character. This person will receive the item, but will not know who sent it. Be careful, however, if you give an item to the wrong person you may end up helping the wrong team...<br /><br />Oh, and you should probably get rid of that dynamite sometime. Who knows when that will kersplode.<br /><br /><br />side note: from your last game, you may think it a good idea to use this power to confirm yourself, but there is no guarantee that any role exists, so it might be a better idea to stay in hiding. if you die, the items go with you<br /><br /><br />additional stuff: gradually learned more about his items<br />actual items were:shield, jugglebug, bow, dynamite, rod, sticky tape<br /><br /><br /><strong>Enig.Matic</strong>:<br />you&#039;re the Hunter.<br /><br />you&#039;re a very skillful hunter, at that. As such, you are much better informed on what has been going on than your brethren. you have handled wolves before, and so you know their game.<br /><br />From being out each night, you have pieced together the existence of two wolves. One light wolf and one dark wolf. the howls are caused by their fighting, and it seems that they have entered a truce of sorts, and settled on alternating kills each night. you cannot identify these wolves, and you cannot use any process of elimination because you have noticed more than two of your brethren sneaking out at night. you cannot identify the others either, as your primary focus is the wolves.<br /><br />you continue to investigate, and learn things frequently as you notice changes in the patterns of the wolves.<br /><br />With your skills comes the ability to foresee the actions of these wolves. you have gained the ability to do so from studying the patterns of these wolves. This ability allows you to know if you are about to be attacked and switch places with the nearest villager.<br /><br />you seem to have misplaced your bow.<br /><br />side note: the &quot;nearest villager&quot; is a random player without any special ability. since the wolves are alternating, the activation of this ability will only be known by one wolf, so the wolf doing the killing the following night may not choose to kill you. furthermore, though you may think this information is vital, you may learn more vital information later, and as such, it may be a good idea to hold out. however, you personally may share any of this information by paraphrasing<br /><br />additional stuff: if equipped with the bow, gains the ability to kill someone at night. sees actions and when wolves shed their skin

				ok, lets look at this game.. it starts of in D1 one person has all the items that define the game... there are two independent wolves that lose two of their biggest strengths.. continuous night kills and communication.. granted by luck danny was able to convert.. but beyond that they werent given the traditional win condition of needing to be 1 to 1 to win (1 wolf 1 human, 2 wolves 2 humans) rather they needed to kill ALL humans.. from the beginning theyre destined to lose.. they got that far by pure luck.. primarily because i got a wolf with an extremely human role.. and no one suspects greg.. its greg..

				Humans had no roles to work with either. And having us move under the assumption that the wolves were a team made it easier for the wolves to hide.

				Me winning was an extremely extenuating circumstance. It couldn&#039;t have happened if I didn&#039;t have a double vote. It couldn&#039;t have happened had I not been able to guard myself. It couldn&#039;t have happened if there were two rival packs(as the game would have ended sooner). But here&#039;s the biggest one it couldn&#039;t have happened if you hadn&#039;t given me the shield. I don&#039;t here you complaining about the wolves being overpowered being able to hop on to the next person. That was the real bullshit. They should have only been able to do that if they had gotten the jugglebug.

				well, i have no idea how phil became a wolf after greg.. that still has yet to of been cleared up... but that was not op at all.. they never got to interact or anything.. still confused, but ben.. i gave you the shield because i believe you would not be able to guard yourself (which is what should happen w. a guardian) which would mean easily i could kill you whenever i wanted to at night.. although, i dont kno how you didnt die as soon as you said you needed the shield..

				Phil became a wolf because whenever one of the original wolves were killed, a human without a role became a wolf in their place. you became a wolf because Dieter had the jugglebug, so he got to pick.

				i kno why I got picked... but the fact that no one killed a wolf till that late is ur own damn fault.. my entire point is, granted he got his objective achieved, the whole &quot;i dont want people to make claims of their roles and it be the end&quot; but he did that by not giving people real roles... i liked the attempt to some degree, but there are alot of things that affected the conclusion that shouldnt of existed
