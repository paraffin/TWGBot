				what...?<br /><br />we don&#039;t get any evidence. he never posted. he wasn&#039;t here, and now he&#039;s still not here, except the ratio of wolves/humans changes slightly towards game loss.<br /><br />it&#039;s d2 there are 8 players. assuming 2 wolves left (which could be true or not) that leaves us d2 n2 d3 n3 d4 n4 before loss if we hit no wolves. today we have no evidence, so we probably won&#039;t hit a wolf. so d2 and n2 out the window.<br /><br />that leaves us 2 phases where we have control to figure out even what roles there are - let alone saving those people / killing the wolves<br /><br />[edit] the only evidence we have basically is that the wolf configuration is not all new players... which was impossible anyway?

				To me it says the wolfs are inexperienced. TRIWolf is likely someone that would have been debated as a possible lynch. It would be much better to try to &#039;frame&#039; someone or at least go after someone who is going to be problematic. Inactives help wolves more than humans.

				no, i don&#039;t think so. especially in this situation where there was a significant argument with a majority of the players on day one. the wolves could have picked a side and killed someone, but that would give us a lot of evidence, possibly even enough to convict today.<br /><br />instead we have nothing.<br /><br />inactives do helps wolves more than humans - and this is why

				Post-mortem suspicions of dieter<br /><br />still connor and guy - i think we&#039;re done talking about those reason until MORE DATA<br /><br />mystic is talking more than normal - same number of posts, but way more sentences. Don&#039;t want us to forget about him.<br /><br />Most of what we have on Haplo can be dismissed as joking. Not a safe assumption, obviously, but there are better things to go after.<br /><br /><br />TL;DR - Will be voting for connor or guy tomorrow.

				I pretty much summed up how I feel earlier.&nbsp; If I&#039;m wrong about guy/Dieter the next most suspicious to me would be Phil or possibly Iron.&nbsp; <br /><br />Actually I&#039;ll just do this<br /><br />1. Dieter - Not entirely convinced he&#039;s a wolf but what he did was dumb<br />2. Reaper- I am vanilla human<br />3. Iron- hasn&#039;t stated any strong opinions so it&#039;s hard to tell<br />4. Haplo- probably just human, idk<br />5. KillaCondor- conner<br />6. Phil- phil being his usual self and not posting a ton, not sure<br />7. guy- could be wrong about him but it seemed pretty obvious he was on dieters side d1<br />8. mystic- has said a lot, and is playing a very good human game, if he is human.&nbsp; He&#039;s one of the best players, so I&#039;m hoping he is actually on our side<br />9.

				the way I see it-<br /><br />1. Dieter idc, dead...made a guardian claim. 99% sure it was false.<br />2.

Iron-kinda suspicious, agrees with aplo alot who I have a poor gut feeling about and isn&#039;t helping his case with his behavior<br />4. Haplo- Gut suspicion tells me wolf, likely my vote for the day<br />5. KillaCondor- idk hasn&#039;t blipped on my radar<br />6. Phil- definitely not a wolf :rolleyes:<br />7. guy- seems regular<br />8. mystic- has said a lot, and is playing a very good human game, if he is human.&nbsp; He&#039;s one of the best players, so I&#039;m hoping he is actually on our side<br />9.

His first vote (for someone in the game?) had bad reasoning, and I agreed with Reaper, so I stuck my vote there. Then he <em>freaked the fuck out</em> that he was suspicious. That&#039;s why I was confident about it. And he never made me have any reason to lose that confidence. It has nothing to do with his first vote. I would have voted for him later even if I hadn&#039;t stuck my vote there in the beginning - except then he probably wouldn&#039;t have been so defensive. That&#039;s why his explanation about wanting to change votes and stuff doesn&#039;t matter. I knew why he wanted to change, obviously.<br /><br />i like that you vote for me after i decide danny human you wolf, then matt agrees&nbsp; :D

				He should have come out and said it if he really was.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know anybody could have not seen it, and frankly I don&#039;t know if I want to play if people aren&#039;t reading things.<br /><br />There&#039;s no secretly explaining to the humans that he&#039;s the guardian while not telling the wolves or whatever. If the guardian is going to get lynched, he may as well come out for real. At the very least we see if he gets nked and then we get a ton of information for d2 instead of nothing. Or he doesn&#039;t and we still get a ton of information, the real guardian could come out, or even he luckily prevents a kill, or etc.<br /><br />Also claim/counterclaim/countercounterclaim shit happens all the time here, it still creates games where you can actually get stuff done.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t that he was angry. I feel his reasonings didn&#039;t make any sense and were just incredibly suspicious. you agreed. (a wolf wouldn&#039;t x)<br /><br />Quit acting like it&#039;s day 4. We all <em>know</em> nobody likes dying d1 (although n1 on n start is worse - which ben alluded to, ha) so it&#039;s not really necessary to say it. If he&#039;s human he could have accepted it, if he had a role he could have come out, if he&#039;s wolf if should have defended himself.<br /><br />Which did he do?<br /><br />Anyway I only considered the he&#039;s human you&#039;re wolf hypothesis because you keep mentioning that it&#039;s just Danny being Danny - which it could be, I haven&#039;t played enough really to know. And I&#039;m not completely sure of the hypothesis because of how funny you&#039;re being about defending him, then not, then doing it.

				Oh and I&#039;ll vote <strong>guy</strong> in case the day ends when I&#039;m not paying attention. Reasons: He&#039;s high on my (our) list and already has votes. Still have my eye on connor and mystic and eventually Haplo, and would obviously like more data on all of them. More posts from connor and haplo. No one else seems to think mystic is highly suspicious so i don&#039;t really see him saying anything telling in his own defense.

				everything is something :D<br /><br />i want to hear what that kid thinks. good wolf pairs are usually one big talker one silent guy<br /><br />also there could be three wolves (7h 3w seems off, 8h 2w is just below optimal but could be offset with roles or a lack of them. 7h 3w with good roles is plausible..)

				2. Reaper - quiet today, needs to talk. few times he&#039;s said something it&#039;s been real though, so at least he&#039;s paying some attention. sometimes. guy expressed he&#039;s probably human, i believe. i think i&#039;d agree for now.<br /><br />3. Iron - doesn&#039;t assert much. normal. but, normal is wolf... so. who knows.<br /><br />4. Haplo - talky talky, some assertions/aggression. could go either way. killing is bad idea right now - ideas and reasoning mean information.<br /><br />5. KillaCondor - new player. not a lot of talking, not a lot of aggression. should be careful...<br /><br />6. Phil - sneakiest bastard ever. could go either way. often acts like the opposite of the role he&#039;s playing - and does it well. needs watched.<br /><br />7. guy - see: haplo.<br /><br />8. mystic - could be a wolf. lots of aggression/leadership looking stuff while following other votes. pretty suspicious. on the other hand, might have a role. probably not an important one (due to taking pretty hefty risks) but possibly one that could change the game slightly. probably a human however, due to the aformentioned risks.<br /><br />10. That_Kid - not talking. not saying anything when he does talk. likely to be nked if he doesn&#039;t say something. could be silent wolf partner. (normally plays like this?)

				Haplo this is shitty I know but I need for you to put faith in me and view someone else tonight. I see that either you or I will be nkd and that would confirm either of us as human but in your death it would confirm is both as where my dying will confirm me human and then you will have a view to work with for d3 I highly recommend viewing iron or guy since they are creating the most stir.

				well then<br /><br />from my perspective, haplo is a wolf obviously<br /><br />which means mystic could go either way, haplo&#039;s &quot;view&quot; doesn&#039;t really say anything about him<br /><br />and phil could also be either, but i&#039;m leaning towards wolf. it&#039;d be pretty damn convenient to use all of that to his advantage. dieter claims guardian and dies, phil is free to mark and claim guardian while haplo is &quot;confirmed&quot; seer.<br /><br />the chance of a mark does seem pretty low in a game this small, but it&#039;s the only thing that really makes any sense<br /><br />well actually maybe phil/haplo decided not to kill anyone and claim guardian/seer out of that

				again the most important course of action is to develop a plan in which no decision the wolves can make can break it. that includes looking at all possible roles everyone could have.<br /><br />it feels too early to be able to make such a plan. we&#039;re going to have to employ some heuristics to get a good chance of surviving until tomorrow, then finish the job then
