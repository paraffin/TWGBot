				<span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">W</span>elcome to The Apotropaic Forest, the place which you have called home for as long as you can remember. As you awake and shake the dew from yourselves you take a glimpse around. The forest appears normal with its towering oaks and deep green pines surrounding you.&nbsp; You look to the north as you do every morning, where a grassy hill towers, and wait for the arrival of the trusted Great White Stag, the protector of the forest, who makes an appearance every morning.&nbsp; You all grow weary as his ghostly figure never appears.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of you bravely climbs the hill and catches a horrible sight on the other side. The great protector of your forest is slumped and still in a puddle of blood.&nbsp; Without a protector, what will you do? Who can you trust? Who killed him? You all look around at the creatures that you thought you knew, but did you really know them all? With the Great White Stag around you never had to worry about who was around you, but now you, the creatures of The Apotropaic Forest, need to figure out who among you are intruders. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It’s up to you, <strong>Creatures</strong>. You must search out and eliminate the <strong>Intruders</strong> before they kill you off like your great protector.&nbsp; <br /><br />The rules:<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of you must choose a lynch candidate once per day and you may change your vote anytime throughout the day.<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each day will last about 96 hours and each night will end as soon as I receive all night actions, or at the 48 hour mark. <br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely no quoting of any personal messages. <br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may talk during the nights but not after death. <br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions at all, feel free to send me a message. <br /><br />The players:<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>penut</del> (Lynched day 1)<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>epplant</del> (Lynched day 3)<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modi Thursday<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>AngryNarwhal</del> (Lynched day 2)<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>Iron</del> (Night 3)<br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dietcar<br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death butt<br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AzraelPariah<br />9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>Mystic</del> (Night 2)<br />10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haplo<br />11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>Reaper</del> (Night 1)<br /></span>

				Yeah there&#039;s plenty that&#039;s not serious, but normally that is accompanied by voting and ferreting and such.<br /><br />It&#039;s an economy of votes and effort though, so if you think you&#039;re contributing to a human win and the votes agree, then that&#039;s what counts.

				Does mystic get offed N1 that often? Poor guy.<br /><br />In regards to dieter being unhappy about guy : I feel like most of the players we have currently are sufficiently active. Games have not felt lacking to me. Maybe aj lurks a lot. <br /><br />Perhaps it was a tad irresponsible of me to initiate it based on no evidence whatsoever, but D1 felt very rushed to me.

So you vote for a probable innocent either way and feel like jumping off the bandwagon is gonna be seen as &quot;Oops, I accidentally went to far trying to kill an innocent and now I&#039;m gonna pretend to be a human by hiding and appearing like I care&quot; when really getting off doesn&#039;t do much at all. That&#039;s how I see it anyway; maybe I&#039;m reading too much into it.

				I&#039;d say guy was probably a vanilla since he never tried to stop it and he&#039;s not a wolf because nobody else really did, either. Perhaps he just didn&#039;t think he&#039;d get lynched/was busy, but a vanilla for the first lynch, without even outing a role first is a pretty good outcome. Wolves gotta stop complaining that he died or somethin. <br /><br />As a wolf I&#039;d have killed someone other than reaper since I haven&#039;t gotten to see him play yet and he&#039;s also had such a long break. Thus I&#039;d guess there are indeed some of you vets on team wolf

				I agree that we shouldn&#039;t reveal all reveal animals. I&#039;m of the opinion that there are (at least minor) clues to role in the flavor, given my own role/animal. There may be good reasons for individuals to give their animals, but I don&#039;t think there are any such situations right now.<br /><br />While Narwhal&#039;s word use is somewhat oddly coincidental, I&#039;m willing to believe that it is a coincidence. By explicitly stating that the word was not a breadcrumb, it makes it rather difficult to in the future go back and say that it really was once the need comes up. It might be that it&#039;s just not very advantageous to confirm breadcrumbs at this stage of the game, but anything there was has been at least partially nullified now. I believe Narwhal on this account (though he has not explicitly stated that he ISN&#039;T a ferret). I also don&#039;t really see how confirming that he&#039;s a ferret would be that damaging, except because Iron thinks that ferrets might be an intruder based on genetics.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s odd that the two people that Iron has on his &quot;List&quot; are two of the first (according to his worldview) to claim animals. There would be plenty of chance for counterclaims if they were wolves making up animals without any previous knowledge. Although there was that one game where wolves eventually got some information about roles and flavor for the humans, and there could be something like that, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very likely. Iron, do you have an explanation for why the potential wolves are also the first animal claimants? It makes sense if you can pull it off - having an earlier claim makes your claim more likely to be true if no one counterclaims. But it&#039;s an odd risk if you&#039;re dealing with nanimals.<br /><br />AzraelPariah - badger<br />Narwhal - probably not ferret, but maybe<br />Modi - I&#039;m a mammal.<br />GestorbenWithShark - Barred Owl (dead)<br />Reaper - Fisher (dead)<br />Trient - Deer (host, dead)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1006.msg43111.html#msg43111">Quote from: AngryNarwhal on February 19, 2013, 10:52:46 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Besides obviously I am a narwhal.

				i agree with dietcar<br /><br />as a sort of &quot;default&quot; strategy in games like this i think it&#039;s a good idea to lynch the person the seer viewed, and then lynch the seer if they are still alive the next day (especially with this sort of half/probable cardflip thing going on) but i don&#039;t really like the way iron came out with that view. he put a lot of effort into convincing us that a weasel is evil before saying anything, which is a distracting and likely unhelpful use of flavor text.<br /><br />i find it unlikely that iron would claim to know narwhal&#039;s creature type without actually knowing it as that would be pretty immediately damning with the post-death creature reveal. but, narwhal flipping as a weasel doesn&#039;t mean that he&#039;s an intruder, unless we take flavor text the way iron&#039;s been encouraging us to (and i&#039;m not confident that is the correct way of doing things)<br /><br />interested in what mystic and AJ have to say about this, especially. when&#039;s the day ending.<br /><br />(unrelated: my sinus mystery is largely better but switched nostrils yay?)

				Sorry for my inactivity. I&#039;m sure you all understand how difficult it is to mount a defense against a claim like this. Especially when there is so much truth to it. I am a weasel, and I am a killer. But I am not a wolf. I am a guardian-vig. If the person I am standing watch over is target by the NK, I fly into a rage and take out the attacker. Since I have to be present to to the guarding, I even get to know who it is that I&#039;ve killed. I don&#039;t prevent views or other things like that, for either of us. <br /><br />I suspect a wolf team of fairly good strength, probably with a few good powers. <br />The reasons a wolf seer like <strong>Iron<strong> would want to take me out are obvious. <br /><br /><br />I guarded Mystic N1 -__-</strong></strong>

				should have guarded reaper<br /><br />i have no qualms with <strong>angrynarwhal</strong> today and iron tomorrow if he&#039;s not already dead. wolf for seer is fair even if we&#039;re the ones doing the killing. if he doesn&#039;t die then he has to try to convince us he&#039;s not a wolf with another view, which is another time to mess up. wolf for guardian is also fair, so i don&#039;t mind killing them both (and neither should both of them.)

				Well that&#039;s a hell of a claim. TBH I expected he&#039;d claim a strong power, but the specificity and uniqueness of the claim makes it more likely to be real.<br /><br />We still don&#039;t have a seer counterclaim, but Narwhal&#039;s claim opens him up to a guardian counterclaim as well.<br /><br />Mystic makes a good point and I&#039;ll probably be willing to go along with it, but I would still like to hear alternatives. If Narwhal is telling the truth after all, it&#039;d be good to have him around.

				i have trouble believing the power because it&#039;s more powerful than anything else i&#039;ve ever heard of, ever.<br /><br />it&#039;s low chance for complete and absolute blowout. i already hate guardian as an ability because it&#039;s either worthless or mvp power that takes control of the game. this one is even bigger.<br /><br />i think it is fair to assume that if narwhal is human then iron is a wolf and his power is basically being activated by our killing them both. basically, sort of.

				Compared to my own power, Narwhal is relatively very powerful if that claim is true. <br /><br />In addition, Narwhal seemed surprised that Mystic gets killed so often N1 (this he said on day two), but then claimed he guarded Mystic N1.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,1006.msg42941.html#msg42941">Quote from: AngryNarwhal on February 17, 2013, 10:13:21 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does mystic get offed N1 that often?

				indeed, i definitely believe that iron knew something about narwhal before he explicitly claimed, and I am sure that he either has some sort of seer powers or is connected to someone who does.<br /><br />i&#039;m less certain about waiting to lynch narwhal after his claim. but there are still things that are still strange/concerning to me about iron&#039;s claim. indeed, i hadn&#039;t thought about the question of why he would drop hints to narwhal, but not to the rest of us, that he had information ON narwhal, if narwhal was a wolf.

				i think GuyWithShark has a high chance of being a human. why would the bad guys let one of their own get lynched so easily on D1? and out of AngryNarwhal, Iron, and Modi Thorson who voted for him, we now know that at least one of them has to be a wolf. <br /><br />so back to the issue at hand. here&#039;s how i see the situation: either iron or angrynarwhal is a wolf. both would-be humans have awesome powers. so i say, don&#039;t lynch either of them yet. let&#039;s try to see if we can find another way to identify who is truly human so that we can try to preserve the awesome power that actually exists.<br /><br />as for whom to lynch today? i&#039;m still trying to decide, but i think it might be wise to not kill angrynarwhal at this exact moment.

				Guys I missed something. I can only use the power every other night. Still, I see how it&#039;s almost too powerful. Which begs the question, why is Iron so much more believable than me? With a human team like that, the wolves are bound to have ways to fight back. At the very least, if I were not me, I&#039;d place Iron at 50% wolf.

				Dieter, if guy was a Hero I do not think he woudl have died without more effort<br />The only one he really picked a fight with was me, not even his bandwagoner or initiator.<br />Vanilla human is my best guess.<br />You can also be certain he is on the opposite team of Narwhal, so thinking Guy is a human is further evidence against Narwhal.<br /><br />I am also a bird of prey, like Penut, though not the same specie.<br /><br /><br />Remember if you lynch Narwhal tomorrow, you can&#039;t lynch me tomorrow if I survive, so keep that in mind.<br /><br /><br />I would welcome a seer counterclaim.

If we lynch someone other than Narwhal tonight we are shooting blindly in the dark, most likely killing a human (particularly if I&#039;m the choice), and not really gaining anything for it except for maybe some hypothetical super powers we&#039;ll get to use if we end up not lynching Narwhal two nights in a row (and he guards the right person). And then tomorrow whether Iron lives or not we won&#039;t be able to use the lynch for anything other than what we should have done today.

				i would most like to kill both and not worry about it. i pick narwhal first only because his power will likely do nothing all game, while iron will have to talk about his power whether he has it or not and has the chance to slip up<br /><br />keep in mind that we can talk at night and get information out of him presumably before he&#039;s dead, if he&#039;s going to be killed. and even if he&#039;s not going to be the nightkill, i still think talking about his seer view at night would be most helpful. for instance, having him seer one person and having that person confirm that he is correct, all before either of them are killed once dawn breaks. provided, of course, that trient doesn&#039;t decide to give the view and start the day at the same time. but that is the problem with night talking and why it&#039;s not supposed to be allowed.

				Man a lot happened while i was in class<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to keep this brief like always.<br /><br />First off, As I live with Guy, I know he was out partying before N1 started. I would not be surprised if he was a human with an ability and didn&#039;t do anything to save himself since he was out and the votes on him were ridiculous, so he probably assumed that he wasn&#039;t gonna actually die.<br /><br />I kinda feel bad for Narwhal now, something he said resonated with me. However I agree with mystic, and don&#039;t really see a way in which narwhal shouldn&#039;t die. We should kill Narwhal today, then Iron tomorrow if he isn&#039;t NKed. <br /><br />Lastly I don&#039;t like how Dietcar&#039;s post seemed to be widely ignored. I think his post is largely bullshit, however I do agree that an Owl could be a seer, and could leave an opening for the wolves to claim seer. I think leaving both alive and lynching someone else is a terrible idea. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t follow the last game closely, but if i remember correctly guy made a similar post last game calling to leave both the seer and his target alive to get more info and Dietcar said that was a bad idea, and this time dietcar is advocating it. Remember guy was a wolf last time. <br /><br />

While I&#039;m leaning towards voting Narwhal at the moment, there&#039;s a number of problems here (note that these problems do not all support the same course of action).<br /><br />1.) I don&#039;t like the above quote of Mystic. Not only does it seem overly aggressive to just try to get both Iron and Narwhal killed, but he also seems to have contradicted himself slightly saying that Narwhal is OP but won&#039;t have an effect all game. The two statements aren&#039;t 100% mutually exclusive, but it&#039;s a bit odd to mention both. For the first part, I would normally give Mystic temporary benefit of the doubt and think that by &quot;kill both and not worry about it&quot; he means kill Narwhal and let Iron die during the night, but he also said &quot;first&quot; - and it isn&#039;t good to kill them both, given that one of them is a human. We should at least wait until more information is available before proposing such things. If this actually means Mystic is a wolf, then perhaps Iron really is a sorc? I don&#039;t actually know what to make of this.<br /><br />2.) There&#039;s a fight going on between eep and death butt. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much evidence of either being a wolf; at the moment, I feel like eep is probably a human, but I can&#039;t say anything about death butt yet.<br /><br />3.) Dietcar wants us to keep both of them alive, and is thus voting for death butt. I don&#039;t know how much I like this. While it&#039;s certainly possible that Death Butt is a wolf, there&#039;s no hard evidence, and so I think it is much more likely for Narwhal to be a wolf, even giving him 50:50 with Iron, since the default is something like 20:80 or 30:70.<br /><br />4.) Narwhal changed his role claim slightly. This could be a last ditch effort to save himself. Though the latter claim is slightly more believable than the first.<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with necessarily killing Iron tomorrow if he isn&#039;t night killed. There are too many ways for that to go wrong. Of course, if we gather any additional information against Iron in the meantime, I will certainly agree to kill him. I think the best bet is having him view someone - someone we trust. He can view me, if he wants. Or someone else, if someone thinks that an Iron-Modi team is possible.<br /><br />

				The point is that if iron is really the seer and we lynch narwhal now, then iron is very likely to get night killed. if we leave narwhal alive it forces the wolves to avoid targeting iron (because if iron gets night killed, then clearly we must lynch narwhal).

				so? if that meant anything then it would be in the best interest of wolves to claim guardian day 1, and wait for a counterclaim, then kill that person. and if there&#039;s no counterclaim then obviously they&#039;re not lying, since there&#039;s no counterclaim<br /><br />that&#039;s only retarded because it&#039;s day 1. so why not try it on some other day, might i suggest, and i&#039;m just pulling days out of nowhere here, day 2?

				If seer for wolf is a good trade, then counterclaiming seer is even better, because the amount of information has increased vastly, plus the normal benefit of trading wolf for seer. I see little reason not to counterclaim, unless a seer realllllly thinks they can manipulate everyone into lynching wolves and the false seer (which indeed some people may be able to pull off, but not most). <br /><br />A wolf counterclaiming means we have more potential liars to investigate. Investigating a potential lie is much easier than investigating a bunch of attitudes (like on a typical D1). <br /><br />A human counterclaiming potentially saves a human and exposes a wolf. <br /><br />Even if you have no other evidence to point out the differences between these two, you can at least default to the first one as a worst case scenario.

If we lynch someone other than Narwhal tonight we are shooting blindly in the dark, most likely killing a human (particularly if I&#039;m the choice), and not really gaining anything for it except for maybe some hypothetical super powers we&#039;ll get to use if we end up not lynching Narwhal two nights in a row (and he guards the right person). And then tomorrow whether Iron lives or not we won&#039;t be able to use the lynch for anything other than what we should have done today.

I don&#039;t like the above quote of Mystic. Not only does it seem overly aggressive to just try to get both Iron and Narwhal killed, but he also seems to have contradicted himself slightly saying that Narwhal is OP but won&#039;t have an effect all game. The two statements aren&#039;t 100% mutually exclusive, but it&#039;s a bit odd to mention both. For the first part, I would normally give Mystic temporary benefit of the doubt and think that by &quot;kill both and not worry about it&quot; he means kill Narwhal and let Iron die during the night, but he also said &quot;first&quot; - and it isn&#039;t good to kill them both, given that one of them is a human. We should at least wait until more information is available before proposing such things. If this actually means Mystic is a wolf, then perhaps Iron really is a sorc? I don&#039;t actually know what to make of this.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Truthfully, in very vanilla games I would generally advocate this as a default strategy, and were I not suspicious of Iron before he claimed, I would definitely advocate the same strategy. the first twg i ever played was absolutely dominated by a wolf who claimed seer d1, got the actual seer lynched, and then just ran the game unquestioned because everyone thought he seemed so human.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, though - how do you think that lynching iron tomorrow could go wrong?

				Other way around - you made it look like Deathbutt is not on your team. You have also cast more votes than many of us, giving us even more data about who might not be on your team.<br /><br />Though if you are a human, obviously you do not know who is on your team. <br /><br />Still, that&#039;s always a good thing to have info on.<br /><br /><br /><br />We haven&#039;t talked about the nightkill yet. Anyone else feel there is something funny going on with Mystic and Reaper? Mystic took some time to say in weird ways that he foresaw Reaper&#039;s death. Then he was next. It is my thought that he intended to claim a role soon, though I have no idea what that might be.<br /><br />Dieter also thought perhaps we had a veteran on the wolf team. The only veterans left are myself (claimed seer), Dieter (brought up the idea in the first place), Haplo, and AzraelPariah.<br /><br />I think I will put my vote on <strong>Azrael.</strong><br />1. He has been voting oddly, sort of trying to cast votes without impacting the game flow much. <br />2. He meets the veteran criterion.<br />3. He was on my watch list earlier, but people have not really seemed interested.<br />4. There have been few votes on him. <br />5. Badgers are pretty aggressive, though that&#039;s not real evidence like the other things.<br /><br />I encourage even the people who think I should die next to consider lynching someone else. We can switch back to me later in the day. I like the way the Narwhal lynch went yesterday - plenty of other votes cast to put some pressure on various people.<br /><br />If anyone has info on the roleblocker, that might be useful in deciding whether the wolves will be able to make me useless every night from now on and thus rather I should be lynched today or not. Obviously if the roleblocker is human they should not out themselves.

Mystic was one of the major proponents of an Iron lynch tonight. Dietcar is now proposing keeping Iron around on somewhat vague grounds. Dietcar has always believed Iron, so it wasn&#039;t a last minute thing (which I count as a point in his favor). On the other hand, he only gave Mystic a 40% change of being human, and Mystic was night-killed. So my first vote today is going on <strong>Dietcar</strong>.

				I&#039;m going with the assumption that we have at least 3 wolves in this game. I feel like we have to kill Iron. If Iron is a wolf, and we assume Guy wasn&#039;t, then we probably lose tonight. Killing him after killing Narwhal guarantees that we killed a wolf, and gives us a much greater chance for us to not just lose today.

				Alright<br />I still don&#039;t understand why you said &quot;Surreee...&quot; to my roleblocker accusation.

We still have a fairly incomplete picture.<br /><br />If you believe both seer and mason claim, then 1 or 2 of Eep, Modi, Dieter, and Haplo are wolves. Probably 2. None of these people have claimed anything IIRC. <br /><br />If you believe that Mystic intended to claim something, that leaves little room for remnant powers. I think each of the four I mentioned are probably vanillas or wolves, though that is not certain. It&#039;s my thought that these four would make good lynch candidates, since a mason pairing is certainly more valuable than a vanilla, especially if they appear to be on the same team.<br /><br />Haplo defended guy even though they are often twiggy rivals, so I don&#039;t think him too wolfy.<br />Dieter is trying to keep me alive, which is a dumbass thing for a wolf to do.<br />Modi and Eep I have little to say about. Modi&#039;s seemed logical. Eep&#039;s provoked some good discussion and been active.<br /><br />People who are intent on my death and say if we don&#039;t kill a wolf today we&#039;re dead, let&#039;s see your numbers. <br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp;penut (Lynched day 1)<br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp;epplant - <br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Modi Thursday - <br />4.&nbsp; &nbsp;AngryNarwhal (Lynched day 2)<br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Iron - seer<br />6.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dietcar - <br />7.&nbsp; &nbsp;death butt - mason<br />8.&nbsp; &nbsp;AzraelPariah - mason<br />9.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mystic (Night 2)<br />10.&nbsp; &nbsp;Haplo - <br />11.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reaper (Night 1)

				i&#039;m going to try to recap what we know so far. feel free to add to it (i&#039;m sure i have missed details and relationships).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><br /><del>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;penut</del> (barred owl)- 90% human - why would wolves let their own teammate get lynched so easily on D1? especially when we know at least one of the 3 people who lynched him must be a wolf, GWS has to be human. <br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp;epplant (?) - unknown. has fought with deathbutt.<br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Modi Thursday (some mammal) - unknown<br /><del>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;AngryNarwhal</del> (weasel) - 20% human (i believe iron)<br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Iron (?) - 80% human (i&#039;m doubling down on the bet that iron is human)<br />6.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dietcar (?) - 100% human<br />7.&nbsp; &nbsp;death butt (?) - claimed mason w/AJ. has fought with eep.<br />8.&nbsp; &nbsp;AzraelPariah (badger) - claimed mason w/deathbutt. has made useless votes.<br /><del>9.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mystic</del> (eagle) - 100% human - NK2<br />10.&nbsp; &nbsp;Haplo (?) - unknown<br /><del>11.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reaper</del> (fisher) - 100% human - NK1</span><br /><br />so we have eep, modi, dietcar (me), and haplo who haven&#039;t claimed anything. and if deathbutt and AJ really are humans, then we need to lynch one of those 4. you probably don&#039;t want to lynch me. <br /><br />and deathbutt and AJ verified iron&#039;s initial claim of there being roleblocked on N2. which seems to mean:<br />&nbsp; #1. deathbutt, AJ, and iron are wolves and they are all making up the roleblocker thing<br />&nbsp; #2. iron is a human and deathbutt and AJ are wolves also claiming they also got roleblocked (but one of them is the roleblocker)<br />&nbsp; #3. iron, deathbutt, and AJ are all human and got roleblocked by either eep, modi, dietcar, or haplo<br /><br />if it&#039;s scenario #1 and we don&#039;t lynch one of those 3, we lose (currently 7 players). but if it&#039;s scenario #1, why even bother making up the roleblocker? why not just have iron say that he viewed eep as a human? (eep would be human in this scenario)<br /><br />therefore, i find scenario 1 very unlikely. i am undecided about #2 vs #3. presumably if someone ELSE got roleblocked on N1 (and he/she was still alive), they would speak up about it and it would shed some light.

				I agree that we probably have at least one more day before we are truly doomed.<br /><br />But I guess I am biased because I am the only one who knows with 100% certainty that Narwhal was a wolf. Let&#039;s do a quick count.<br /><br />Worst case:<br />7 players. 4 humans, 3 wolves.<br />Lynch a human. 3 humans, 3 wolves.<br />We lose after a successful NK.<br /><br />So, assuming guy is a hooman, hoomans might well lose if I&#039;m not a hooman. If l was indeed a wolf, you would have to lynch me today and not tomorrow.<br /><br />From my perspective, however, it seems hoomans are on the right track. I understand this doesn&#039;t help anyone else, but here&#039;s the #&#039;s anyway.<br /><br /><br />Worst case:<br />7 players. 5 humans, 2 wolves. <br />Lynch a human. 4 humans, 2 wolves.<br />After NK: 3 humans, 2 wolves.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;d give us a decent (about 50% chance) of us lynching a wolf if we pick from those who haven&#039;t claimed. <br />Obviously my views, or at least distracting the roleblocker, increase those chances.

				right, i mean if i were confident that you were human, then i would have no problem keeping you alive<br /><br />but as i am not confident about that, it is much, much safe to lynch you, and we still have a fair amount of time left to figure out the rest of the players<br /><br />as is, your argument is basically that it&#039;s better to shoot randomly into a group of 4 players than for everyone else to guarantee that we kill at least one wolf before the day&#039;s out<br /><br />so, i&#039;m eyeing you, and i&#039;m eyeing the players that seem to be following this reasoning (dietcar, haplo)

But why it lasted all the way through N2 is odd, when Iron&#039;s block was just instantaneous. It could just be the way the roles work, since blocking a seer only means anything at one particular instant. It makes AJ and Death Butt&#039;s description seem a little bit odd, but could also conceivably call Iron&#039;s claims into question. I can&#039;t figure much into at this point - I think that it&#039;s essentially true that everyone got roleblocked for one cycle, and it just looks a little different for the two parties.<br /><br />All I&#039;m getting from Dieter is &quot;something very bad will happen&quot; if he dies.

				Can you point to anything where I may have known your role? I had no such knowledge; I was roleblocked that night.<br /><br />From the point of view of me, AJ, and Butt, it doesn&#039;t seem logical to have a hider and a blocker, but I suppose it is possible...<br /><br />My vote will depend a bit on what happens relative to Dieter&#039;s vote count (I&#039;d prefer if AJ took a side), but I don&#039;t like this claim and I don&#039;t think AJ and Deathbutt should either.

				I am somewhat hesitant to reveal my role, since it could potentially gain us a day if the wolves don&#039;t know about it. I will say that I am a possum - a clever possum, specifically. I do not have a particularly powerful role, nor one that is very likely to come up, and even if it does, it only has a small chance of helping us out (it will never directly <em>hurt</em> us, though), so I might just reveal it anyway.<br /><br />We&#039;ve killed at least one wolf, maybe two (I think it&#039;s somewhat odd that Iron got NK&#039;d, since that pretty much confirms him, which would be a bad decision on the wolves&#039; part unless they&#039;re really confident they can win anyway). So let&#039;s just assume we&#039;ve killed two, which means there&#039;s only one left. From my view, this is either Dietcar or Haplo. Assuming Iron is a human, I&#039;m also prone to think that death butt and AJ are humans as well.<br /><br />If a human dies each of today and tonight, then we&#039;ve still got two humans and a wolf, which isn&#039;t particularly good odds - and worse odds make revealing my role less intelligent. I would like to hear more about others&#039; perceptions of our current odds, as that is really what determines how much I can reveal, but I personally don&#039;t think revealing my role will help any if you&#039;re already suspicious of me, since it won&#039;t provide much information and it all comes down to whether you believe my claim or not. <br /><br />So I guess all I can really say (TL;DR) is that I&#039;m a Clever Possum and that my role has a chance of giving us some extra time.

It&#039;s relatively weak evidence, but we also have very little evidence against anyone else, so I don&#039;t know if we could say that you are more likely to be vanilla than wolf.<br /><br />So we&#039;re left with:<br />Modi, the clever possum.<br />Dietcar, who causes bad things when he dies.<br />AzraelPariah, the badger.<br />Death Butt, the mason with AJ<br />Haplo, the something<br /><br />So I guess there&#039;s still a few questions to ask, like what the remaining animal types are. This goes maybe the most for Haplo, who is under the most pressure. But I also want to consider other possibilities.<br /><br />At this point, it&#039;s fairly certain that Iron was a human, and so Narwhal was a wolf who is now dead.<br /><br />If eep was a wolf, then we&#039;re down to one wolf, so probably not one of the masons. Which leaves Dietcar and Haplo. Dietcar has supported Iron, but also never voted for Narwhal. Haplo has been very quiet, but voted for Narwhal (and not last minute either - he could have voted for Death Butt to force a tie).<br /><br />If eep was a human, then we&#039;ve got two wolves, who could be (Dietcar and Haplo) or (AJ and Death Butt).<br /><br />Both of these teams seem unlikely - Dietcar has voted lots for Haplo and is really trying to get him killed today. AJ and Death Butt seem to be on the same team as Iron. So there&#039;s probably only one wolf left, and Haplo actually doesn&#039;t make that much sense. Dietcar never voted for either Narwhal or Eep, our two probably wolves. <br /><br />I guess it&#039;s slightly more likely that there&#039;s still two wolves left from your perspectives.

My personal opinion is that the amount of definite information against Haplo is awful small for this late in the game.

				The wolves&#039; sole power being roleblock gives me an idea for a game in which the wolves&#039; sole power is roleblock<br /><br />Each wolf has this power but it only works if you say the name of the role you&#039;re blocking and who has that role.<br /><br />In other words, it would change the VERY NATURE of CLAIMING ITSELF.

				regarding haplo, though; the reason I didn&#039;t change my vote to him actually had very little to do with his being my teammate.

				because it was funny, and nobody would know what to make of it<br /><br />also, in retrospect, it would have prevented the mason claim<br /><br />i disagree that wolves really stood a chance, though. There were as many human player who could view alignment as there were wolves, one of which had a chance of doing so with host confirmation. Refusing to vote for haplo wasn&#039;t a great choice on my part, but I wouldn&#039;t have done differently if you had chosen modi instead.<br /><br />I suspect that if you ran the same game again, there would only be a few situations in which the wolves could actually pull off that game. And whereas humans did a lot of things that were dumb as shit and got away with them, wolves didn&#039;t really have that same freedom.

				in fact, dieter, what are you imagining would have happened if I had voted for haplo instead? then there would have been a 3-way tie. that might have saved me temporarily, or i might have died anyways and it would have been a wasted vote. And even if I had survived, too large a portion of the players were more or less confirmed to make it anything other than luck of the draw for wolves to win.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t *impossible* for wolves to win, but it also wasn&#039;t impossible for humans to win the last game. That doesn&#039;t make a game well-balanced. We figured out most of the game and most of the roles that the different players had. We generated a fair amount of confusion regarding what was actually going on. Our play was not significantly worse than human play.

				I agree humans were overpowered.<br /><br />I also agree with guy that vanillas aren&#039;t as boring/useless as they&#039;re often made out to be, you just have to figure out an interesting angle, for example trying to draw the NK.<br /><br />Iron catching Narwhal on the first night was pretty lucky. It&#039;s hard to defend against a seer view that early. Using a unique role lifted from last game as a claim wasn&#039;t the best idea though I think.<br /><br />For those who didn&#039;t see in the other thread, I&#039;m going to wait a little while before hosting my game since I&#039;m going to be pretty busy in the immediate future, so someone else should host something TWG-ish soon.

				One thing I thought of doing with AJ though was having him claim mason but say he couldn&#039;t reveal his partner because his partner was the guardian. Then I&#039;d come out and say I wasn&#039;t really the guardian so that the real one didn&#039;t counterclaim, but try and make it look like I really was the guardian and was trying to cover up AJ&#039;s mistake. That would hopefully draw the NK or roleblock to me, possibly confirming AJ and protecting people with real powers.<br /><br />But it seemed a bit convoluted and I decided against it. Could have been fun but oh well.

				As far as everyone saying that the humans were so overpowered: If you think about it, wolves know who is human, but humans have to try to guess at who is who completely. I thought that giving more of a chance to the humans to actually figure things out and not guess quite as much might have been an interesting twist on the game.&nbsp; Any thoughts on this view of what I was doing?

				Right, I mean that&#039;s why you don&#039;t start the game with 50% wolves unless there&#039;s something really interesting going on. But the wolves actually had a great deal to figure out: who the likely roles were, which players they could safely target for night kills without backlash, which players could be safely targeted for lynch without risk of claiming a particularly believable role. In a very particular instance: we chose to night kill mystic because of his response to narwhal&#039;s claim. We didn&#039;t KNOW that he was the guardian, but we needed to patch that sort of information together to decide who was the best kill. Also, death butt, your guardian claim would have been entirely unconvincing because of your response to narwhal, and would probably have only worked to wolf advantage.<br /><br />The thing is, we, as wolves, did a pretty good job figuring out which players had which roles based on clues dropped in the thread, better than any other game I&#039;ve played as a wolf. We guessed that modi might be something like bulletproof because he was so comfortable saying that he had a role, but not specifying what it was. We guessed that reaper had some sort of role, more based on gut feeling than anything else. If you look at the roles we knocked out with out night kills, we were hitting well enough that, I think, a balanced game would have at least leveled the playing ground against a few of the mistakes that, say, narwhal made.<br /><br />If we had chosen our nightkills poorly, however (for instance, targetting dietcar n1), and if iron and reaper had gotten lucky, the ENTIRE WOLF TEAM could have been revealed by d2. And our one power, roleblocking, ended up being used against us by more or less confirming the masons. There was the potential of a huge, rapid confirmation of players that we couldn&#039;t really have done anything against.<br /><br />So, I disagree with the idea that wolves have nothing to figure out, and I think the distribution/function of human roles significantly reduced the amount that the humans needed to figure out.

				percent change of things working is the worst mechanic. don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />this was the most upsetting game i have played. adding in the night talking rule then saying we couldn&#039;t talk about our night actions literally ruined the game for me. i didn&#039;t even care that i died.<br /><br />night one i said &quot;guard me if that&#039;s ok, otherwise reaper&quot; since i knew he would die, lol. that was cool.<br /><br />but then night two we couldn&#039;t talk about our night actions and i based my entire activity day 2 on that being ok. it&#039;s fine that i ended up guarding iron since he helped a lot but i would rather play than guess.<br /><br />also i don&#039;t recall anyone ever guessing my role (i&#039;m pretty sure i kept up with the thread)<br /><br />my initial plan without even doing anything would be to guard myself every night and be an asshole then guard myself when i was about to be lynched, if it came to that. then keep guarding myself at night? who knows. trient probably would have changed the rules though. but then when narwhal came out as a &quot;guardian&quot; role i figured i could play with that during the night actions, but then that got banned away as well.

				yeah, to be honest the way we critique games after they are done is not all that different from how my advisors critique my thesis work at reviews<br /><br />But, fundamentally what we are doing is making suggestions concerning how to improve games you host in the future. I think you did a good job of creating some pretty complete flavor text, and I would enjoy seeing more of that. On the other hand, I do think balance was an issue. Plus, to me, a good part of the fun in twg is playing the guessing game. I don&#039;t really like playing seer or wolf because that gives me answers I would rather deduce for myself; guardian or mason is okay, but really, my favorite role is probably vanilla.<br /><br />(also, relevantly, I think all of our recent games have ended with either balance issues or at least one player being disappointed haha)
