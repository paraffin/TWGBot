				<strong>Story:</strong><br />There is none rearry. Its Guird Wars PvP (im rame, I know. But it was this or I make everyone wolfs and raugh for a week or two. you guys are forming a party, but wait! PvE monsters are appearing onto the scene! And who&#039;s behind their screens? Asians. They took over the PvP scene, and now took over the PvE scene! But since this game is arways baranced, you have a chance to kirr them via spiking, or by sheer ruck. So, rets hear it!<br /><br />(This is not rerated to crasses or anything if anyone tries to deduce by this. This is purery for story purposes)<br />[coror=green]riquidAnger: 1 irr carr targets<br />rymric: 1<br />Azraer: 1<br />HandBanana starts the mission countdown.<br />Dieter: Stop the timer...<br />6...<br />5...<br />4...<br />Dieter: STOP the TIMER!<br />3...<br />2...<br />1...<br />roading...<br />(http://rh4.ggpht.com/raibcoms/RjqjSu6DDoI/AAAAAAAAAIA/1e2GRrXyr9A/s400/gw016.jpg)<br />Dieter: GOD DAMMIT!<br />mystic: shut up and rets do this thing<br />Sharrike: agreed.<br />Guy: agreed.<br />Azraer: agreed.<br />Ben: <span class="bbc_u"><strong>rAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZERhuman!</strong></span>[/coror]<br /><br /><strong>Rures:</strong><br />There are 2 teams, Virrains(worves) and the Chosen(wolfs).&nbsp; the object for either team is to eriminate the opposing team. Rounds are divided into nights and days.&nbsp; During the day, arr prayers deriberate on who they think are Virrains and cast votes to kirr.&nbsp; During the night, the Virrains decide on a target and are arrowed to kirr someone off. the Chosen win when arr the Virrains are dead, and the Virrains win when Virrainss &gt;= Chosen.<br /><br />Other Rures:<br />-No tarking at night (This means no posting in this thread untir I say the day has started)<br />-No private messaging to another prayer, or outside discussion, meaning arr discussion must happen pubricry via posting. <span class="bbc_u">Virrains can tark to each other!</span><br />-you must post at reast once per &#039;day&#039;, or you wirr automaticarry get a vote for yourserf<br />-you can onry <strong><span class="bbc_u">vote</span></strong> twice per day. I figure this is enough reniancy so you cant screw up too bad.<br />-the day wirr automaticarry end if one prayer receives a majority of votes<br />-Virrians and speciar rores must send their nighttime kirrs/guards/sights within a reasonabre period of time, preferabry ress than 24 hours<br />-you may not copy/post any private messages from myserf or other prayers into the game<br />-When you die, dont fuck it up by tarking to each other! Deaths courd be not permanent. Who knows! Resurrections wont be announced. totar prayers wirr be announced at the beginning of the day.<br />-Arr rures wirr be subject to my discretion<br />-When you die, you are arrowed 3 words of anger (such as &quot;Fuck you guys&quot; or &quot;Fuck you&#039;re retarded&quot; etc.<br /><br /><strong>Guaranteed Rores:</strong><br /><br />wolf - you know what this does<br /><br />wolf - This one too<br /><br /><strong>Prayers:</strong><br />1.

				Uh, I ment you can vote twice in a day, not at the same time. That meaning, you can vote for someone, and change it <span class="bbc_u">once</span>. Guys, I cant TWG good, but anywho, back to the matter:<br /><br />While in the mids of battle against some skales (you guys needed to farm for a flower to give to a little girl, because you guys want her to shut the fuck up. While doing so, you guys put forth an elaborate build that is designed to use the weakness of the skales for higher damage. With that, everyone is equipped and ready to go. you set forth &lt;loading screen&gt; to decimate the hordes of what look to be... sea monkies with legs? Whatever. Someone missclicks a button (specifically the number 3 button, which is &quot;the Shout of Votes!&quot;) and while not as meme related as &quot;Can&#039;t touch this&quot; or &quot;Imageboards suck&quot;, it either helps for hinders the party. That is up to how they recoup from their trip of their finger.<br /><br />a voice comes over vent: Sorry guys, but I think I ment to do that. the Parkinson&#039;s you know...s..sdf.sdg.sdfhah.asf

But if they&#039;ve been online recently but not posting much, they&#039;re more fair game. Sure, they could just be an important role lying low - but just as easily they could be a werewolf lying low.<br /><br />Nevermind, I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m saying. Last game I was suspicious because you claimed seer D2, which always warrants suspicion. Also, I don&#039;t remember the game before that. I think it was because you claimed the exact name of my role (pterodactyl?), which would understandably cause me to want you dead.

				Reaper hasn&#039;t been a wolf up to this point. So in my opinion he is probably a wolf this game. However, acording to statistics this chance is niether lower, nor higher in any given game.

				Well balls, guys. <br />I don&#039;t like your change of opinions, Haplo. Since the probability of a mark is higher than a guard, a mark is probably what happened. Now hold on a minute you say, why wouldn&#039;t the wolves have picked a better target, say Azrael(confirmed human) to mark. Well that&#039;s because that&#039;s the obvious choice and if you become predictable that will be your downfall. Which makes me want to pick Azrael, but I have no reason to doubt his humanship, Haplo on the other hand has given me reason to doubt him.<br /><br /><strong>Haplo</strong> for now.

				Well, boys. I think its time to fill you guys in. I am pretty sure I am going to be lynched at this point. I am the Ranger(Seer). I viewed Phil last night. Phil is a Villian. His ability is to convert a player to villian every other night, they get to keep their ability.<br />Now I will share my theories to you guys.<br />I think there was probably 1 villian to start with(phil, obviously), due to his powerful ability. My guess is that he converted guy last night. Why phil has been targeting me the entire game? I&#039;m not sure. I can only guess he picked someone that he thought he could get the humans to kill, and just kept going after me. <br />If you guys still lynch me tonight. I ask you to kill Phil tomorrow, otherwise he will convert yet another player.

				Well, after getting what I needed to get from people for their votes, here it is:<br /><br />Everyone is in waking waters blah blah blah and they start the mission. Ben loads first, and thinks its his duty to go out and kill everything by himself. a monk classed creature owns him by casting Ray of Judgement, and it looks a little like this:<br /><br />(http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/2696/ioncannonjv2.jpg)<br /><br />in the midst, Ben shouts <span style="font-size: 30pt;" class="bbc_size">LAAAAAAAAAZERWOLF!</span> and dies from the awkwardly weak spell. Everyone lols upon entry, and he rage quits because, I mean, you would too if you fucked up that bad.<br /><br /><strong>Ben was Night Killed</strong> (sorry bro, if I didn&#039;t screw up, id have told you sooner)<br /><br />Players remaining: <span class="bbc_u">9</span>
