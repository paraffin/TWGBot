				(https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash2/50333_131540773562978_8368_n.jpg)<br /><br />Welcome to beautiful Sunburg, Ohio - where everyone is being Kyle Craig (https://www.facebook.com/events/131540773562978/). It is a simple way of life, being Kyle Craig. However, one day, you stumble upon the dead body of <strong>Dieter</strong>, who was just being Kyle Craig. There must be impostors, seeking to seize control of Sunburg! They will, probably, stop at nothing and kill everyone if necessary.<br /><br />You, the Sunburgers, seek to rid Sunburg of the impostors. You win once they are all dead.<br /><br />Here&#039;s everyone that is Kyle Craig:<br />1. <del>That_Kid</del> day 3<br />2. AJ<br />3. <del>Iron</del> day 1<br />4. Eep<br />5. <del>Guy</del> night 3<br />6. <del>Trientalis</del> day 2<br />7. <del>Mystic</del> night 2<br />8. Liquidangel<br />9. <del>Dr. Agon</del> night 1<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Typical TWG rules apply.</span><br />1. Vote as many times as you want, bolding your vote.<br />2. Don’t talk if you’re dead.<br />3. Don’t talk outside the game to anyone playing.<br />4. Yada yada yada<br /><br />I&#039;ll send out PMs shortly and start the game once I&#039;m done. <strong>If you don&#039;t get any PM at all, PM me for clarification!</strong>

				In retrospect, a Valentine&#039;s Day themed game could have been funny too, but oh well.<br /><br />Day 1 begins! I shall attempt to end it at 6:00pm on Friday 2/10, since people will probably be busy on Friday night.

				All you need to know is that I&#039;m the real Kyle Craig. Unfortunately there is no way for me to actually prove that on this site (short of you scouring to find people calling me Kyle), and that honestly has no real bearing on the game.... because everyone is me.

				There&#039;s a tiny door in my office, Maxine. It&#039;s a portal and it takes you inside Kyle Craig. You see the world through Kyle Craig&#039;s eyes... and then after about 15 minutes, you&#039;re spit out... into a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. <br /><br />This is the best theme I&#039;ve ever seen.

				I am voting <strong>Mystic</strong> because my human role PM also mentions impostors, Mystic usually reads shit (like the intro), and it&#039;s unusual that he (or anyone) would latch onto something so misdirected. <br /><br /><br />Eep also seems confident and I&#039;d be interested to know his confidence level.

				Eep, my vote on you is not because I have evidence that others should not vote for me. It&#039;s because *I* know that I should not die and thus it is statistically more likely that you are a wolf than that I am.&nbsp; That argument is why I think it&#039;s ok to vote for you, not why people shouldn&#039;t vote for me.<br /><br />The only reasons I can offer to not vote for me is that I&#039;m claiming human and that I am always active. The reasons you shouldn&#039;t use to vote for me include randomness and being shocked that I read the introduction.<br /><br /><br /><br />My message indicates that I am trying to win against impostor Kyle Craigs, does not make mention that I am one, and I followed a similar train of logic to guy in deducing that I&#039;m pretending to be Kyle Craig (back to that first thing I brought up in this game about good guys and bad guys all being Kyle Craig)

				1. That_Kid - helping subtly, think he&#039;s human<br />2. AJ - committing what I consider to be a fallacy in saying avoiding death is wolfy, but this doesn&#039;t mean I think he&#039;s a wolf. Could be.<br />3. Iron - 100% human unless this is a That_Kid style trick PM (unlikely)<br />4. Eep - Thinking across games, eep often does exactly this. I don&#039;t like it because by her definitions whoever she attacks always looks like a wolf by her criteria, Spanish Inquisition style. On the other hand this seems to be the only way we get D1 data so I do see why she keeps doing it. I think votes should be considered more carefully as night phase approaches and that critical period began last night/this morning.<br />5. Guy - Seems human, especially because his claim seems similar to my own.<br />6. Trientalis - Lurker. Statistically these are good to lynch when there&#039;s not much to go on, but we have like 8 pages already.<br />7. Mystic - Either a human or a wolf role-claiming safely and reasonably. Now a piss-poor lynch choice.<br />8. Liquidangel - Lurker who popped in to claim a name. Surprised Dr. Agon didn&#039;t yell at him for it but it&#039;s probably a joke - my PM didn&#039;t even give me a name.<br />9. Dr. Agon - guy wants to lynch him for notcraig.<br /><br />1. That_Kid - 75% human<br />2. AJ - 40% human<br />3. Iron - 100% human<br />4. Eep - 40% human<br />5. Guy - 75% human<br />6. Trientalis - 50% human<br />7. Mystic - 60% human, 90% hero if true<br />8. Liquidangel - 50% human, 25% hero if true<br />9. Dr. Agon - 60% human<br /><br />By these numbers I think perhaps AJ is the best lynch of all due to him provoking less discussion than eep despite having the same chance. <br /><br />Eep is a good choice because she is become the avatar of Iron opposition - she is a better choice than I if you agree with my strategy/thinking, and I&#039;m a better choice than her if you don&#039;t agree for the same reason.

				it is possible that i was looking too hard for suspicious material in iron&#039;s posts, and in doing so i may have projected my doubts erroneously upon him. that being said, his preemptive offense to potentially perceived defense gives me a weird feeling. i&#039;m also gaining a budding suspicion of mystic, just because i think it&#039;s possible his statements about his role could just be a means to cast doubt and make us second guess what we already know. however, it is never a good idea to vote for someone who claims a role, especially on D1 when we have relatively little to work with. i&#039;m going to leave my vote the same for now.

The above are the only three people who actually claimed it (although Mystic has since taken back that claim). Knowing that I am the real Kyle Craig and that Matt says he is only a sunburger (which he took to mean Kyle Craig, but his PM didn&#039;t actually state it). This leads me to believe that the only other people who claimed Kyle Craig are imposters. <br /><br />So right now I choose to vote for <strong>Trient</strong>. This is due to the lack of further posts by her about her first claim. That_Kids claim was kind of weird and not exactly a claim and as stated earlier Mystic revoked his claim.

				Ok. I went through this whole thread again. <br /><br />Here&#039;s what I got out of it<br /><br />1. That_Kid - I&#039;m not sure yet<br />2. AJ - Could be human, could be wolf<br />3. Iron - claims to be human. Why lynch someone who clams to be human on the first day?<br />4. Eep - doing to Iron exactly what she did to me last game.<br />5. Guy - I&#039;m not sure yet<br />6. Trientalis - hasn&#039;t made many posts lately. Sorry guys.<br />7. Mystic - claims that he knows there is one real Kyle Craig and he is a good guy. Kind of backs up what LiquidAngel said earlier<br />8. Liquidangel - Claims to be the real Kyle Craig in game and real life<br />9. Dr. Agon - I&#039;m not sure yet <br /><br />Based on what I&#039;ve gone over I don&#039;t have a strong enough reading to tell who is wolf and who is human. Anyway, the only vote that I could put in that would even change the game now is for eep, making it a tie vote. I don&#039;t have a strong enough case against her yet, and I don&#039;t feel like someone that is claiming human so strongly should be lynched first day, but it&#039;s looking like what is going to happen. Is everyone&#039;s vote in stone now?

				I just caught up.&nbsp; I am starting to doubt mystic and liquidangel.&nbsp; mystic seems to be trying to tie himself up with liquid, or perhaps the two of them know the same thing and liquid is approaching the situation by deflecting attention onto himself.&nbsp; either way, I don&#039;t like what mystic has done so far and I find it quite suspicious.&nbsp; I have believed Iron was human all along, although I see his deflectiveness as suspicious also.&nbsp; I give you the advice that you shouldn&#039;t be just explaining your actions, but also convincing others of what actions to take.<br /><br />I believe I am too late, but I also don&#039;t like AJ and how he plays this game.&nbsp; I know he would be acting this way regardless of if he was human or a wolf, thats just AJ, but it FEELS wolfy.&nbsp; I hate my instinct sometimes.&nbsp; mainly, I don&#039;t like his fear of being part of a bandwagon and essentially telling us he is wasting his vote.

				Ok, I&#039;m just going to say, this week is going to be really stressful for me workwise. So I may as well say what I can now.&nbsp; I see that all of you are starting to get really suspicious of me. If you look at my history of playing this game, I really am not all that active with saying things. This has been one of my least active games though, due to outside influences. <br /><br />All that aside, I feel like it would be a bad idea to pounce on me just because I haven&#039;t been saying all that much. I really believe that we lost two humans already and that we probably have at least one or two wolves in this game. We have 7 total players left.&nbsp; I feel like Mystic is willing to vote me off solely because I put my vote on him last time.&nbsp; This would lead me to believe that he is either a wolf trying to vote off anyone casting suspicion on him, or that he is someone with a role who doesn&#039;t want to die.

				but that&#039;s such a basic move, i think i&#039;d rather go balls to the wall than do that<br /><br />unless i had a sweet partner staying in the shadows and not doing anything<br /><br />but that&#039;s not the role i&#039;d want to play in the team<br /><br />in any case, we obviously lost one human (barring dueling packs), and statistically it&#039;s likely that we lost another human during the day 1 vote. not a huge deal, it&#039;s going to happen in almost every game. today is a day to vote people off who are silent <em>regardless of their reasoning for being silent</em> because tomorrow is the day that makes or breaks everything, and we <em>have to</em> have very active players during that day<br /><br />if we make it to day 3 and have two players who don&#039;t have time to post more than once in the day, it&#039;s over

				I&#039;m still sticking with what I said yesterday about who I don&#039;t trust the most, but the nightkill intrigues me. Given the choice between Mystic or Dr. Agon as special roles who claim to not be Kyle Craig. The only reason to choose Dr. Agon is if you believe Mystic will be guarded. (Also I&#039;m barring myself as a special role claim because clearly people don&#039;t really believe me and the wolves can use that to their advantage.)<br /><br /><strong>Mystic</strong> was on my list from yesterday and maybe he actually made a mistake instead of joking about the Kyle Craig thing. In the last game I used a very similar tactic about attacking inactives when I was a wolf because both wolves were active and it made it easier to get humans lynched during the day. Keeping active players alive longer to further discussion is a good goal, but it plays to the wolves if they are both active players.

				what did i make a mistake about<br /><br />my mistake is at best that i didn&#039;t read &quot;everyone is a kyle craig or a fake kyle craig&quot; (i mean, joke theme, come on) from the intro, so i was wondering why someone would assume this<br /><br />as for not being a kyle craig, i&#039;m not. i was just fucking around during my first post and then, haha, i guess it turns out that can be an actual claim in this game<br /><br />but, i&#039;m drawing a blank on when doctor agon made a claim - i don&#039;t recall him saying anything about it? that changes the nature of the nightkill - i assumed the wolves were just being as inconspicuous as possible, executing basically one of the more average choices. maybe i&#039;m misreading what you&#039;re saying

I should&#039;ve left it alone though because all I ended up doing was drawing attention to it. The best I can do for him right now is to give the wolves an even bigger choice. I was lying when I said that the real Kyle Craig doesn&#039;t have a power. I do and it is fairly significant.

				mkay, at the moment, i am most suspicious of aj and liquidangel. i think that mystic is almost definitely human regardless of whether aj is human, and it&#039;s quite possible that aj has some sort of seer abilities regardless of whether he is human, especially since he supposedly got role info which seems kinda weird for a proper human seer.<br /><br />liquidangel was discouraging aj to come out which makes me think they cannot both be wolves, but i think it&#039;s very likely that at least one of them is.<br /><br />trientalis is really hard to read because she does this thing where she only really accuses people who express suspicion of her and normally this is suspicious but it is also what she does as a human, so :/<br /><br />guy is playing almost entirely by jokes that he comes up with which is kinda enh but not necessarily suspicious. i don&#039;t really know what to make of him.<br /><br />that_kid is a little bit suspicious to me but i don&#039;t really want to vote him because he&#039;s always a little bit suspicious to me.<br /><br />so I think the wolves are one of (aj,liquidangel) and possibly 1-2 of (trient, guy, that_kid). iron was too okay with getting killed yesterday for me to be totally comfortable calling him more than 60% wolf; I doubt that both trient and guy can be wolves.<br /><br />so, this is why i&#039;m leaving my vote on kyle craig.

				I am, in a roundabout way, the funkin Spy. I know Craig is a human. I have always known. Those who guessed that we were working together early on were half right, since I&#039;m sure he doesn&#039;t know that I know.<br /><br />Because of how specific AJ was in his seer view, I&#039;m 95% clear on him as human, as well.<br /><br />I implore Craig to come out with the way his role works <em>exactly</em>.<br /><br />That means we better fucking damn lynch someone else. Here&#039;s why:<br /><br />There will be 5 people tomorrow. The three of us will not make it because we <em>will win</em>, so one of us will die.<br /><br />So, of the five left, there are several combinations.<br /><br />Me and Craig. Craig gets two votes, so we can at least cause ties if two wolves convince the last human on who to vote for. This isn&#039;t the best, but it will mostly be a pulling day for one person.<br /><br />Me and AJ. This means AJ got a seer view. I can ask him the last part of my role that we haven&#039;t revealed, if he gets it, I can be completely confident in his role. This means that out of the 5 players, 3 will have confirmed roles. Majority wins.<br /><br />AJ and Craig. Seer view + Double vote. An excellent combination.<br /><br />That means that today, we lynch one of the people who aren&#039;t this. I have to agree with Guy on Trientalis, sadly. That leaves eep, that_kid, guy.<br /><br />The NK will then be one of me, aj, craig. If it&#039;s not, then there&#039;s no way we don&#039;t win. In any case, if there is a guardian (I doubt it) then they should pick one of me, aj, craig, whichever facet they think the team needs the most for the showdown on day 3.<br /><br />This is all excluding reverse-seers, three wolves, super-donkeys, etc. But I feel confident that there aren&#039;t any or that we can adjust the strategy if there are.

what sense does that make? if aj, mystic, and liquidangel are all telling the truth, why are none of them dead? i can see why aj might not have been targeted because he didn&#039;t come out yet, but liquidangel and mystic clearly said that they were both something special, even if liquidangel said he didn&#039;t have any specific power. and also why dr. agon again because he said he might be busy iirc, so leaving him alive would be beneficial to the wolves, i would think. none of it really makes any sense. and for that matter, why wasn&#039;t i targeted?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://mysticboards.us/forums/index.php/topic,893.msg34236.html#msg34236">Quote from: Dr. Agon on February 10, 2012, 06:39:31 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just caught up.&nbsp; I am starting to doubt mystic and liquidangel.&nbsp; mystic seems to be trying to tie himself up with liquid, or perhaps the two of them know the same thing and liquid is approaching the situation by deflecting attention onto himself.&nbsp; either way, I don&#039;t like what mystic has done so far and I find it quite suspicious.&nbsp; I have believed Iron was human all along, although I see his deflectiveness as suspicious also.&nbsp; I give you the advice that you shouldn&#039;t be just explaining your actions, but also convincing others of what actions to take.<br /><br />I believe I am too late, but I also don&#039;t like AJ and how he plays this game.&nbsp; I know he would be acting this way regardless of if he was human or a wolf, thats just AJ, but it FEELS wolfy.&nbsp; I hate my instinct sometimes.&nbsp; mainly, I don&#039;t like his fear of being part of a bandwagon and essentially telling us he is wasting his vote.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>maybe because he named the wolves?

				this is more the way that things work:<br /><br />if kyle craig is his own imposter, then so is mystic<br />if mystic is an imposter, then so is aj<br /><br />aj is the only claimant who could be lying without implicating anyone else, so either we have 3 confirmed humans (which I find highly unlikely), all wolves in a connected clump (which i also find unlikely), fucked up game mechanics (which is very possible but not an assumption i&#039;d prefer to consider without reason), or aj is a wolf<br /><br />so imma go all occam&#039;s razor on this game and vote <strong>aj</strong>

				So am I the only person without a role in this game? Also, by not having a role, that makes me suspicious? Again, killing me off is not the end of the world for this game because all I am is human, but I feel like we should be trying to find the wolves. If we assume that all of the people that have claimed seer, spy, and Kyle are telling the truth that would make sense but then we also have eep claiming a role which she still is being very secretive about.

				mystic your plan hinges on the assumption that aj is a seer which i do not believe<br /><br />if he is a sorcerer then he would still be alive tomorrow and would probably claim that a human is a wolf or vice versa and make it less likely that we lynch the actual wolves<br /><br />i feel like there is a good chance that he is not a seer and i do not really want to rely on whether he survives to find out whether that is the case<br /><br />also now that i am thinking about it i doubt he&#039;d even be killed if he were a seer, just because that would leave 2 confirmed humans on a day when we have to lynch a wolf. assuming normal game mechanics.<br /><br />i dunno, i just don&#039;t see the benefit of keeping him around and don&#039;t think he&#039;s likely to be a human anyways.

				Trient says a lot of wrong things that I was going to reply to but pretty much all of them have been covered anyway so f it. As far as everything else goes I can confirm that I at least do not have the power of seer. Which I guess doesn&#039;t make much sense because why wouldn&#039;t the real Kyle Craig be able to see imposters, but a lot of this game doesn&#039;t exactly make sense. The possibility of sorcerer seems scarily real to me right now based on the power available to the humans if eep is telling the truth (with just me and Mystic I believe that a seer is likely). I disagree with killing anyone claiming seer until tomorrow though and throwing any suspicion on AJ just makes it more likely that he will live through the night (this is probably the reason I am still alive after my claim).<br /><br />Also holy shit, I take an exam and come back to 22 new replies.

				Eep I feel like some clarification may be required on your part as to what&#039;s up with your role. Also it looks like were left with a bunch of people that don&#039;t want to talk. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to go ahead and put my vote on <strong>AJ</strong>. <br />1.) He&#039;s been acting suspicious since the beginning of the game.<br />2.) I don&#039;t like that he viewed Liquid last night as it just makes me think that they&#039;re in cahoots.<br />3.) Hopefully this will get some discussion going.<br />4.) With Liquids supposed tie breaker ability voting for anyone else leaves me dead and I&#039;ve made it this far might as well try to make it to the end?

				I don&#039;t like the fact that he viewed me either, and did you miss the part where Mystic stated my role then died? I am also really not liking AJ right now, but not enough to kill him yet. I also don&#039;t like that eep can&#039;t say anything about her role. It is a really easy way for a wolf to slip through without a real claim.<br /><br /><strong>eep</strong><br /><br />Right now I happened to like your position less than That_Kid, but it might just be both of you. Also, guy is probably going to be very busy this weekend so that kind of kills discussion, and AJ is with him so....<br />

				That sounds fairly interesting and highly likely based on what Mystic&#039;s role was. Back to <strong>That_kid</strong> (not liking Guy either). I am starting to think that AJ might be sorcerer, but he probably has a partner in that case and if we have 2 wolves left chances are the partner is either that_kid or guy. The real problem is tomorrow. Whether we kill AJ or not. Sorcerer is a tricky role.

				hahahaha, but seriously she played really well if she is the wolf. Reasons I voted for you are:<br />1. You jumped really hard to claim bullshit on her yesterday before there was really much of a reason to.<br />2. You viewed me after I was pretty much confirmed giving no extra information to the humans.<br />3. (and this could just be very good play by her) I wasn&#039;t targeted last night.<br /><br />All it really comes down to though is a coin toss. She came up with a fantastic role within this game&#039;s setting for a wolf and she almost deserves to win just for that.<br />

				i would like to point out that nobody ever counterclaimed seer, and i came out on D2. if iron were seer, i think he would have mentioned something to avoid getting lynched. that just leaves Dr.Agon as the last possible seer besides me, who was NK&#039;d. i think it&#039;d be pretty bullshit for a sorcerer to be able to view someone and then NK that same person on the same night (that is far too OP), which either means I am the luckiest sorcerer alive or the seer.

				the confusion was i got mystic&#039;s side and a description of his personality (he&#039;d talk about kyle craig all day if i&#039;d let him), but not the exact name of it. in liquid&#039;s view, it specifically says he is the real kyle craig, but it doesn&#039;t say anything about his tie-cancelling power. the views are kinda cryptic, and i was forced to guess at what mystic was. but it pretty much just says kyle is kyle. i think the views might include 1. allegiance and 2. the player&#039;s relation to the true craig. if a hypothetical second seer viewed me, he&#039;d probably see something along the lines of &quot;sent to study the craig.&quot; at least, this is how i interpret my role.

				so i don&#039;t get my role at all<br /><br />i was pretty certain craig was a wolf<br /><br />i win if he lives<br /><br />but since he&#039;s a human, the only way for him to live would be if humans live... meaning i win<br /><br />

				well sure but i thought the point of ending the game when there are more wolves than humans is that they would necessarily overpower the humans in voting

				i guess<br /><br />the point of your role was basically to cause chaos. you were a cult leader in essence, but your win objective didn&#039;t conflict with both humans and wolves (since this is a smaller game).<br /><br />i don&#039;t understand why you didn&#039;t try to recruit anybody.

It seemed like your role was pretty much being able to tell people that I&#039;m the real Kyle Craig. If you picked a wolf it would just confirm that for them and let them kill me (although if they were wolves they would know I wasn&#039;t lying anyway so....).
